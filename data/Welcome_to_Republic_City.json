The two girls dismount the bison on air scooters as Tenzin goes to greet his mother and tell her how happy he is to see her. He subsequently asks for her help as his son is biting his head. Katara chuckles and takes Meelo, who tries to escape her grasp, shouting, \"Unhand me, strange woman!\" His father tells him that she is his grandmother, and the boy somersaults over her head and lands behind her. Jinora stands in front of Katara, telling her that she has read everything about her old adventures and has been dying to ask what happened to Zuko's mother, to which the waterbending master says it is an incredible tale. However, before she can continue, Ikki interrupts, jumping in between the two and talking rapidly, asking many questions, annoying her sister."
