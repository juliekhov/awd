Protected by the tides of the Ocean and Moon Spirits, the Northern Water Tribe's North Pole stronghold was once considered impenetrable by the Fire Nation. However, when Admiral Zhao learns that the Avatar has sought refuge there, he convinces Fire Lord Ozai to grant him the ships necessary for a full-scale assault. His plan? Capture the Moon Spirit and strike at the weakened Water Tribe. To defend them, Aang must call upon a powerful elemental force, but at what cost to himself and his destiny?\" (Based on the episodes \"The Siege of the North, Part 1\" and \"The Siege of the North, Part 2\".)"
