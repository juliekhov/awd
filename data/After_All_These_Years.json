Mako asks Wu why they are leaving the hotel so early, considering their dinner at Air Temple Island is only later that evening, and the prince is only getting a haircut. The royal excitedly corrects the firebender, gushing about the luxurious spa treatment that will take at least four hours. As they near the exit, Wu's ramblings only come to a halt when he notices a crowd outside and immediately assumes that they are fans of his in town for his coronation. Despite Mako's warning that they may not be there to support him, Wu proudly struts out onto the red carpet and poses for the people, even letting his picture be taken with two female fans. However, Mako notices several people clad in green among the crowd stalking toward Wu. Realizing the potential danger, he scoops the prince up and places him inside the waiting Satomobile, urging the chauffeur to drive while the protesters hurl strawberry pies at them. When Wu asks what happened, Mako tells him that he suspects Kuvira supporters were hiding in the crowd."

Mako admits to his Chief of Police that he cannot wait for the royal's coronation, longing to return to his detective work. Much to his shock, however, an apologetic Lin tells him that he will be relocated to Ba Sing Se as the prince personally requested him to be his bodyguard indefinitely. She tried to stop it from happening, but it was beyond her power since he is being used by Raiko as a political pawn. When an Air Acolyte notifies the gathered group of the arrival of a ship from the Southern Water Tribe, the congregation happily leaves to welcome Korra."
