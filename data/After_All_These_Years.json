As they near the exit, Wu's ramblings only come to a halt when he notices a crowd outside and immediately assumes that they are fans of his in town for his coronation. Despite Mako's warning that they may not be there to support him, Wu proudly struts out onto the red carpet and poses for the people, even letting his picture be taken with two female fans. However, Mako notices several people clad in green among the crowd stalking toward Wu. Realizing the potential danger, he scoops the prince up and places him inside the waiting Satomobile, urging the chauffeur to drive while the protesters hurl strawberry pies at them. When Wu asks what happened, Mako tells him that he suspects Kuvira supporters were hiding in the crowd."

When he tells Tonraq that they are all excited to see the Avatar again, the Chief of the South is confused and concerned by his words, as he was under the impression that his daughter was in the city; she had written letters to him that led him to believe she had been there for the past six months. Equally confused, Tenzin ensures him that his daughter is not with them, leaving everyone to wonder about Korra's whereabouts."
