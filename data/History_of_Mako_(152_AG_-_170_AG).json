The waiter complied with the order and showed Mako the table, where Asami was already waiting for him. During their date, Mako learned she was the daughter of the successful industrialist, Hiroshi Sato, and was invited by her to personally meet him, an offer Mako gladly accepted. When Mako met Hiroshi the next day at Future Industries, the industrialist informed Mako that, after hearing Asami about his team and its financial problems, he had decided he would sponsor the Fire Ferrets' bid in the Pro-bending Tournament, provided that they would bear Future Industries' logo on their uniforms. Excited to be able to participate in the tournament after all, Mako readily agreed to wear the logo on their uniforms and promised the Fire Ferrets would make the most of that opportunity."
