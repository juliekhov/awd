Looking below, Aang spots a wolf spirit running along the path Appa is flying. While Sokka and Katara bicker, Zuko tells Aang that there is nothing down there despite his witness to the spirit and orders Azula, who has stood herself on the ledge of the saddle, to get down. She instead jumps down so she can get to Hira'a first, but Aang catches her with the aid of his glider. She swiftly burns a hole in glider and causes the two of them to crash. Zuko tells the others to check on Aang while he chases after his sister."

These notes were written by Gene Yang and the Gurihiru team, with further contributions by Michael Dante DiMartino; the series co-creator's additions are a notable distinction for this Library Edition, having not been included in The Promise Library Edition. The following are notable points from the Library Edition that pertain to The Search Part One's early production phase and trivialities as attested by the aforementioned crew members."

Those ideas directly influenced the human-spirit interactions in the story.\" (p. 48)\n DiMartino notes that the story of The Search is not solely about Zuko's \"external search for his mother, but also his internal search for who he really is.\" This fact is exemplified in the cliffhanger of Part 1, when Zuko's life and identity are suddenly not as clear as he once thought. He also enjoys how the final page of the story is drawn with the words in the backdrop, appreciating how it \"might look odd in an animated version, but has such impact in a comic panel.\" (p. 78)",
