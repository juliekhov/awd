They had been working together for less than two years when they were invited to appear on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. That and other TV appearances led to their own syndicated show in 1985, called Comedy Break, and they subsequently taped 125 half-hour episodes in less than a year. Dryden and Alcroft continue to perform at corporate events around the world and have earned a reputation as clean comedians.",
