In the large, ensuing storm, Aang recounts to Katara the events of his dark past. After being told he was the Avatar, Aang was ordered to be separated from his mentor, Monk Gyatso. Upset, Aang ran away from his home where he encountered a deadly storm, causing him to fall into the water, activating the Avatar State, trapping him within an iceberg. Meanwhile, Iroh tells the ship's crew Zuko's story. After speaking out of turn at a war meeting, Zuko was punished by being forced to fight an Agni Kai against his own father. His refusal resulted in him getting his scar and being banished for perceived cowardice. Meanwhile, Aang learns that Sokka and the fisherman are trapped in the storm; he rescues them, earning him the fisherman's respect. Zuko spots them, but lets them go, instead opting to escape the storm.",

In the large, ensuing storm, Aang recounts to Katara the events of his dark past. After being told he was the Avatar, Aang was ordered to be separated from his mentor, Monk Gyatso. Upset, Aang ran away from his home where he encountered a deadly storm, causing him to fall into the water, activating the Avatar State, trapping him within an iceberg. Meanwhile, Iroh tells the ship's crew Zuko's story. After speaking out of turn at a war meeting, Zuko was punished by being forced to fight an Agni Kai against his own father. His refusal resulted in him getting his scar and being banished for perceived cowardice. Meanwhile, Aang learns that Sokka and the fisherman are trapped in the storm; he rescues them, earning him the fisherman's respect. Zuko spots them, but lets them go, instead opting to escape the storm."

A flashback shows a lively Southern Air Temple, where Aang is showing his friends how to use his air scooter technique. At that moment, Gyatso and the other elder monks tell him to follow them as they need to speak with him. In their meeting room, they tell Aang that he is the Avatar. As proof, they show him the four toys he picked from thousands when he was younger, revealing them to be the Avatar relics, toys that have belonged to previous Avatars, his past lives. Although Aang notes that he chose them because they \"seemed fun\", Tashi says that he picked them because they seemed familiar to him. Gyatso admits that they normally would have waited to tell him about his Avatar destiny until he turned sixteen, though because \"storm clouds are gathering\", signs of an imminent war, they need the Avatar."

Aang notes that it is not necessary and the fisherman circumvents his wife's wishes by offering them a free fish instead. When Aang announces that he does not eat meat, the fisherman claims that fish is not meat. When Sokka approaches the fisherman, desiring to claim his pay for working on the boat, he receives a fish, much to his horror.

This is further shown in the episode \"The Avatar and the Fire Lord\", when the Fire Sages told Roku that he was the Avatar on his sixteenth birthday. Avatar Korra is an exception to this rule, since she discovered she could bend multiple elements on her own before she was old enough to have been trained."
