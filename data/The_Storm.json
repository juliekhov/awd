Although Katara rushes to her side and says that she is safe, the woman declares that her husband is not, since he and Sokka are still out at sea, caught in the storm that is evolving into a typhoon. Determined, Aang declares his will find them, and Katara immediately resolves to accompany him, while the elderly woman makes herself comfortable in the cave, noting that she will remain there."
