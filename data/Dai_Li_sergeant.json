Sometime later, the Dai Li sergeant led a training session where he attacked the airbenders with earth disks to test their defensive skills.

He promptly evaded an airbending blast Kai conjured in anger and trapped the boy in an earth column, before ordering Dai Li agents to take the boy to solitary confinement.",

He reprimanded Kai for showing mercy toward Yung and forced the former to attack with fervor and never to apologize. Sometime later, the Dai Li sergeant led a training session where he attacked the airbenders with earth disks to test their defensive skills. Frustrated by Kai's attempt to defend Yung, he attacked the young boy with a barrage of disks that sent him to the ground before telling him that he was not as good as he thought. He promptly evaded an airbending blast Kai conjured in anger and trapped the boy in an earth column, before ordering Dai Li agents to take the boy to solitary confinement."
