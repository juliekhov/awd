      "text": "After Aang and Toph's metalbending students rescued everyone from the cave-in, Vachir had his injuries tended to by the Air Acolytes; Jingbo bandaged his pointer finger. Afterward, he and Kahchi were ordered by Loban to retrieve their rhinos to haul a giant iron mask back to the beach so he could ship it to his own plant in the Fire Nation for processing and the subsequent profits. On the way, however, a storm developed, making the transport difficult. Vachir was soon shocked when Sokka's boomerang snapped the ropes connecting the animals and mask. At Loban's demand, the archer took on Sokka, but lost his bow and arrow after another toss from the warrior's boomerang, thus, he was forced to fight hand-to-hand. He quickly became unnerved when his foe taunted his abilities and, when he tried to land a punch, was grabbed and thrown to the ground. He and Kahchi were left behind as the spirit General Old Iron emerged from the water."
