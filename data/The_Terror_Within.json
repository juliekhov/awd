Wing launches several chunks of metal at Korra, who dodges them and retaliates by sending a metal cable snaking toward him. Wing avoids it and, by taking control of the attack, manages to knock Korra over, capturing her with her own cable. He expresses excitement and disbelief that he is sparring with the Avatar, while Wei voices his disappointment over being stuck with Bolin, who is unable to metalbend a meteorite despite his efforts. Fed up, Wei crushes Bolin between two metal plates before sending a meteorite at his head, announcing with amusement that the best way to learn is by practice. Defending himself, Bolin ducks underneath the meteorite and retaliates by striking his opponent in the middle of his forehead with a pebble, earning himself a compliment from Mako, despite his emphasis on the fact that the purpose of the session was to practice metalbending. While Bolin tells his brother that learning metalbending takes time and considerable effort, Korra manages to get back on her feet, wrapping her cables tighter around her before unleashing them with more force, sweeping the feet from underneath Wing and winning her match. As she smugly announces that she is the \"metalbending champion\", Bolin dismisses her success with annoyance, attributing it to her being the Avatar. Asami remarks that it is almost time for Opal's farewell dinner, causing Bolin even more distress."
