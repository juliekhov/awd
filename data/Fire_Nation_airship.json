Using over a dozen warships and the enhanced powers granted to the firebenders by the comet, these airships commenced to burn down the Earth Kingdom. These plans were thwarted, however, when Toph, Sokka, and Suki hijacked one of these airships and rammed it into the rest of the fleet. Meanwhile, Aang used his enhanced powers to destroy Phoenix King Ozai's personal airship, which was three times the size of a conventional airship and adorned in a more ceremonious manner. While Aang took care of Ozai, Sokka, Suki, and Toph continued their progress by forcing the remaining airships to crash into each other, effectively saving the Earth Kingdom."
