While Mako discussed the allegations with Lin, Lu and Gang searched his apartment. Lu discovered a bag full of money and explosives, a find he gleefully announced to the others. Gang instantly handcuffed the firebender, declaring that he should have known that Mako would conspire with the Triple Threats due to his past. When Asami came to Mako's defense, an amused Lu brushed her objections aside by labeling Mako as a crooked cop who had just been using her. Gang seconded that statement and laughed away Mako's protests that it had been Varrick who was setting him up while he led the firebender out of the apartment."
