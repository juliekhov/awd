A worried ${link_6} asks ${link_7} if there is any way he can accompany them, and he explains that he cannot, since ${link_8} ${link_9}, who has asked him to stay in the city, wants help finding a diplomatic solution for ${link_10}'s actions. Overhearing her parents' conversation, Ikki tries to ensure her mother that they will be fine, referring to ${link_11} and ${link_12}, who were about the same age as her and her siblings when they traveled the ${link_13}. Reassuring herself that at least her children will not starve to death, Pema gives them a large bag of ${link_14} to take on their journey. Meelo quickly rejects the provisions, however, declaring that they will have no need for them, as they are going to be living off the land. When Pema reveals that she has prepared his favorite snacks, sweet buns with happy faces, Meelo drops his attitude and accepts the food. Opening one of the wrapped sweet buns, however, he discovers that its happy face has been smudged and promptly declares it inedible. After Pema tells him that such things happen in the wild, ${link_15} loads the bag on Pepper's saddle. While Pema hugs Meelo and Ikki goodbye, Jinora embraces her father, who asks if she has been able to hone in on ${link_16}'s spiritual energy. While Jinora admits that she has not, she assures her father that once they are on their way, finding Korra will be easier and that they should be able to complete their mission within a few days. After hugging her mother goodbye, Jinora seats herself atop Pepper's head, taking the reins, while her two eldest siblings sit on the saddle. When Tenzin wishes them luck and reminds Meelo and Ikki that Jinora is in charge, Meelo denounces her authority and orders them all to move out. Jinora sighs resignedly at his antics and urges Pepper to take to the sky. Watching them depart, Tenzin hugs Pema in comfort.",

A worried Pema asks Tenzin if there is any way he can accompany them, and he explains that he cannot, since President Raiko, who has asked him to stay in the city, wants help finding a diplomatic solution for Kuvira's actions. Overhearing her parents' conversation, Ikki tries to ensure her mother that they will be fine, referring to Aang and his friends, who were about the same age as her and her siblings when they traveled the world. Reassuring herself that at least her children will not starve to death, Pema gives them a large bag of food to take on their journey. Meelo quickly rejects the provisions, however, declaring that they will have no need for them, as they are going to be living off the land. When Pema reveals that she has prepared his favorite snacks, sweet buns with happy faces, Meelo drops his attitude and accepts the food. Opening one of the wrapped sweet buns, however, he discovers that its happy face has been smudged and promptly declares it inedible. After Pema tells him that such things happen in the wild, Jinora loads the bag on Pepper's saddle. While Pema hugs Meelo and Ikki goodbye, Jinora embraces her father, who asks if she has been able to hone in on Korra's spiritual energy. While Jinora admits that she has not, she assures her father that once they are on their way, finding Korra will be easier and that they should be able to complete their mission within a few days. After hugging her mother goodbye, Jinora seats herself atop Pepper's head, taking the reins, while her two eldest siblings sit on the saddle. When Tenzin wishes them luck and reminds Meelo and Ikki that Jinora is in charge, Meelo denounces her authority and orders them all to move out. Jinora sighs resignedly at his antics and urges Pepper to take to the sky. Watching them depart, Tenzin hugs Pema in comfort."

Ikki berates Meelo, shouting the food was supposed to have lasted them for two weeks. Jinora interrupts them, asking to stay quiet so that she can meditate, and Meelo quickly agrees with Jinora, specifically telling Ikki to keep quiet. Exasperated by Meelo's actions and attitude, Ikki reiterates that he threw away all their food, to which he responds that from that moment on, they will hunt for their meals.

Sitting down beside the Avatar, Toph's voice mellows as she explains that she knows that Korra wants to get better. Similarly, she continues, the Swamp desires the same; it senses that Korra is out of balance and will teach her what she needs to learn if she is open to listening. The Avatar indicates that she is willing to try, and Toph asks her why she believes she saw visions of her past enemies attacking her. Korra conjectures, unsure, that she may have seen them because of the suffering they inflicted on her and others. Toph states that Korra is carrying her enemies with her the same way she carries the poison, refusing to let go of it, and asks her if she has ever considered that there were things to learn from her enemies. Ignoring Korra's skepticism, Toph proceeds to state what her enemies sought to achieve: Amon wanted equality for all, Unalaq brought back the spirits to the physical world, and Zaheer believed in freedom, but she concluded that they were all out of balance, which led them to take their ideologies to the point of extremism. Korra wonders why they are haunting her and Toph tells her that she needs to face her fears, as she cannot deal with future threats if she is still occupied with those of her past.

      "text": "Toph finds Korra sitting alone on an arched tree root and asks her if she has her dinner. Korra answers negatively, explaining that the Swamp made her see visions of her enemies hurting her. To Korra's displeasure, Toph says she thought something like that might happen, leading Korra to ask if Toph intended to torment her with those visions, calling her a twisted old lady. Sitting down beside the Avatar, Toph's voice mellows as she explains that she knows that Korra wants to get better. Similarly, she continues, the Swamp desires the same; it senses that Korra is out of balance and will teach her what she needs to learn if she is open to listening. The Avatar indicates that she is willing to try, and Toph asks her why she believes she saw visions of her past enemies attacking her. Korra conjectures, unsure, that she may have seen them because of the suffering they inflicted on her and others. Toph states that Korra is carrying her enemies with her the same way she carries the poison, refusing to let go of it, and asks her if she has ever considered that there were things to learn from her enemies. Ignoring Korra's skepticism, Toph proceeds to state what her enemies sought to achieve: Amon wanted equality for all, Unalaq brought back the spirits to the physical world, and Zaheer believed in freedom, but she concluded that they were all out of balance, which led them to take their ideologies to the point of extremism. Korra wonders why they are haunting her and Toph tells her that she needs to face her fears, as she cannot deal with future threats if she is still occupied with those of her past. When Korra asks how she can move on, Toph, sighing that Avatars need a lot of hand-holding, orders her to follow her to the banyan-grove tree."
