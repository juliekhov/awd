      "body": "So when we request for a White Lotus Classifieds, are we limited to asking for beta-readers, editors, and illustrators? I sort of need someone to help me plan the last chunk of my fanon because I made a planning error in a previous chapter that will hurt the rest of the plot. However, because you guys are limited to those three options, I can't use the Classifieds, which is a bad thing because I know a lot of people will see those requests in the WLS issue. Just as a general suggestion, I think it will benefit your project if users can request any fanon job they want for a classified. BlackMonkey Talk - Fire & Ice 01:24, July 5, 2012 (UTC)",

In the first issue, the articles closely resembled the articles pertaining to fanon in the BSST, just in a different newsletter. Well what if you guys wrote articles about fanon the same way the BSST writes about canon? They write opinion pieces about Zutara, so you could write opinion pieces about fanon ships. The BSST has polls, what about fanon polls? The BSST has wiki urban dictionary, what about fanon urban dictionary. If you did this, it would encourage readers to check out the fanons referenced, breathing new life into the entire portal. Omashu Rocks (Talk - Crossfire)  21:23, August 22, 2012 (UTC)",
