When he was eighteen, he convinced a wealthy businessman to invest in the idea of mass production of automobiles for the common man. Before long, he was producing Satomobiles in his first \"Future Industries\" factory. By the time he was twenty-five, the ingenious industrialist had made his first million yuans. Realizing that not everyone in Republic City could afford their own Satomobiles but needed transportation nonetheless, he created a taxi cab for the less wealthy to get around in the city."
