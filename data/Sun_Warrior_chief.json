With the help of two aardvark sloths, he freed them from their precarious situation, but wanted to punish them severely for taking their ancient relic. Zuko and Aang managed to persuade him not to condemn them and show them the original way of firebending instead. The chief told them that if they wished to learn the true way, they would need to pass the judgment of the masters, Ran and Shaw, and proceeded to lead the duo to the Eternal Flame. He presented them each with a part of the ancient flame before sending them on their way to the cave of the masters. The chief also warned both of them that the masters may be angry to see them because Zuko's ancestors hunted the dragons for glory and Aang neglected his duties as the Avatar by running away. Once Zuko and Aang arrived at the base of the master's cave, he conducted a ceremony to bring them out. When the masters presented themselves, he and the rest of the Sun Warriors bowed down in respect."
