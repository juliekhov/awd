However, the synopsis section for ${link_0} and ${link_1} is long too, and the movie is at least 4 times longer than a regular episode. If we have a summary of the Detailed Plot in the Synopsis, then someone has to constantly reconcile the summarized plot and the detailed plot in two different pages.
