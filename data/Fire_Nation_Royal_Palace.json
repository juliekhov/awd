One of these chambers contained the intercepted letters that Ursa wrote to Ikem as well as several other items, including traditional garments from the Earth Kingdom, Water Tribes, and Air Nomads. The door to this specific chamber was hidden behind a painting and would open when someone firebent at the painting."
