Tenzin tells them about the current condition and explains how it is thanks to Zhu Li's leadership that things are going well before he goes on about Raiko's involvement, noting that he is preoccupied with his reelection as his popularity has dropped drastically after he surrendered the city to Kuvira a few days prior. Korra and Asami offer their help and Kya suggests that an appearance of Korra as the Avatar would lift the spirits of the evacuees. Korra agrees to the idea, asking Asami if she wants to join her, however the latter declines, saying she would rather talk with Zhu Li about some practicalities. Taking offense at this, Korra retorts which results in a minor argument between the two. The moment gets interrupted, however, by Tenzin who urges Korra on to meet the crowd and offers to join her, as Asami regretfully looks away with Kya in the back glancing at her pitifully."
