Several evacuees make requests, making her nervous under the pressure. Tenzin joins her side and suggests they head back, however Korra has an idea and earthbends a podium, holding an inspiring speech and promising the evacuees to make things up, upon which the crowd cheers. Tenzin and Korra return to the tent where Asami has started to work on plans for new housing developments. Curious about what she has in mind, Korra joins her while Tenzin and Kya watch the two, stating that they make a good team. Korra suggests showing the plans to Raiko in order to get money from the city to realize the housing plans."
