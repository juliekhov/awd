So I called up Paramount and chairman Brad Grey and asked him to come to New York. I was very cryptic about the whole thing. \"What is it about?

If you're in a snow environment, it starts moving snow. If you're in a dirt environment, it starts movie dirt. You just have to keep it translucent enough so you know that it's not another element, but the element of air. So there was a careful analysis of each element, and ILM would start to do tests for me and show me different things. Water I really felt like I wanted it to be like when I saw stuff from astronauts when they'd open up a Gatorade bottle and it stays connected, but it's kind of moving. And they touch it and it starts moving again. That was the basis of water; I wanted the water to look it was in zero-g. So they went under those kind of principles. ILM has a huge amount of experience with water in particular. I really like some of the stuff they did with the 3rd Pirates and the whirlwind of water as the boats are going down. They have a huge amount of experience. They were the first ones that started this stuff with The Perfect Storm. So it was a real long process, but super, super exciting. Each and every time it had to be a combination of what the character was doing and at any time, nothing could look the same. It was wasn't like you could do waterbending twice and make it look the same. And that was the thing, I think, when the burden of what went to such a high level. They would come up with one way effectively, and I was like \"Great, now come up with eighty more!\" \u2013 because nobody does it the same way. That was the fun thing for me because I got to express character through CGI. Then I could really talk to the animators and say \"Katara isn't skilled yet, so it should be very fragmentary with things falling off the edges.\" I could talk in character like that. Or \"This person is angry\" and so on.",

I'll be tense. \"Well, what do you want?\" \"Hold on guys, this isn't right. It's just not right. Just give me five minutes and I'll figure it out. Okay, we're taking this apart. We're taking all of you guys out and putting you out in the hallway. It's gonna be a walk and talk while you're getting on the elevator.\" I don't have that option to do that. By the time I realize I would have done it differently, so much money and time has been spent. There's just no way to tell ILM to start from scratch. It doesn't work like that. So that's a super, super challenging thing. I guess I've learned a new skill of being able to imagine even more in my head and hold to it as long as I can.",

There was at one time a \u2013 I think their background was Chinese \u2013 a Sokka and Katara. One of them was a better actor than the other, and I was gathering my pros and cons. \"Let's say that was that, what would the Fire Nation be?\" And you just do that. Being without agenda and letting it come to the table. Noah's like a photo double for the cartoon; I mean he's literally spot-on. To me, the best part is, I didn't really know their backgrounds. Noah, for me, has a slightly mixed quality look to him \u2013 so I cast airbenders as all mixed race. So when you see the monks and that stuff, they're all mixed. And it kind of goes with the nomadic culture that over the years all different nationalities came to the table. The Fire Nation was the most complicated. I kept switching who was playing Zuko. It was such a complicated and drawn out thing about practical matters. The first person I was considering for Zuko was Ecuadorian. So I started thinking that way. And then when that person couldn't do it, the second person who came in was much more Caucasian. I was like, \"well then we have to switch the others. All right, now how are we doing this?\" What is the Earth Kingdom was always the issue because the second movie is so dominated by that group, and will represent most of the movie, but it has a small, small part in the first movie. That was important. It just sort of came into being and started to distill.",

I always pictured the kid from Searching for Bobby fisher as the lead of The Sixth Sense. \"We are not casting hiring any blonde L.A. kids, okay? Don't even bring them in!\" And Haley came in \"... You got the part!\" How can you not have him play the part? So that's always been my lean. I have hopes of what I want them to be. My hope was that this movie would be incredibly diverse. When we look back on the three movies, without peer, they were the most diverse movies of all time. And that is the case when you watch the movie. It's not like an agenda like when you see a picture of a kid's school with kids on the swings and there's one from each background \u2013 it's not like that. It's a real thing. This nation has this ethnicity and when we go deep into that culture, we'll see more and more of that. Again, Dev ended up being my choice for Zuko. I looked for an uncle that could be in that realm. For a moment there I thought of Ben Kingsly. ${link_0}, who I loved in Iron Man, took us into kind of a Mediterranean, Arab and Indian world. I can go as far as that.

The consensus with the production designer and myself, and consequently with James, was it's a flavoring. It's not Asian. We're not in Asia, but it's influenced by it. What medieval stuff is to Lord of the Rings, Asia is to us. It's influencing it, but it's not necessarily: that's a kimono or that kind of thing. The same thing goes with the music. We toyed with the idea of it being very Crouching Tiger, but we ended up going with its influenced but it has its own world. So I'm really excited for you to hear the score.",
