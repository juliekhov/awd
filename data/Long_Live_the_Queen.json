The prisoner in the cell next to them asks if he could go with them and tells the brothers that he has been locked up for four years; while not seeing his family for the first several months of his incarceration meant he could finally get some sleep, he now longs to see them again. Mako, ignoring his neighbor, devises an escape method which would require Bolin to metalbend the cell open. He tells Bolin he has total faith in his metalbending abilities; however, when their neighbor asks if he really can metalbend, Bolin tells him he cannot. Mako starts motivating the other prisoners to cheer for his brother, and Bolin finds the confidence to try, but much to everyone's disappointment, he fails."
