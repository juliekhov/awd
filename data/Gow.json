As he closed in for the kill with his twin hammers, Zuko rose up and used firebending in conjunction with his dual broadswords. Gow proved to be no match for the firebender and was quickly defeated. When the shocked soldier demanded to know who he was, Zuko announced his true identity and reclaimed his knife."
