Aiwei assures the airbender that all incriminating evidence was burned in a fire, but Zaheer merely dismisses him as a loose end and hurls him into the Fog of Lost Souls. Zaheer returns to the grove, where he confronts Korra; to her great surprise, he promises to answer any questions she might have for him. She asks who Zaheer and his group are; he responds that they are members of the Red Lotus, a secret society dedicated to restoring freedom to the world. When Korra asks if they are related to the\u00a0White Lotus, Zaheer explains that the Red Lotus is a reflection of what the White Lotus was intended to be: The Red Lotus was founded by a former White Lotus member named Xai Bau, who felt the White Lotus had lost its true purpose after\u00a0the Hundred Year War\u00a0when they came out of hiding to openly serve the Avatar, seeing this as essentially reducing itself to a group of glorified bodyguards who served \"corrupt nations\". Brushing off the explanation as a \"great story\", Korra notes that it does not explain why they tried to kidnap her as a child. Much to her shock, Zaheer reveals that it had been Unalaq's idea."
