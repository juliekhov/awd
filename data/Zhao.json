However, due to Aang's contact with his past life and the spiritual power of the winter solstice, Zhao instead found himself confronted by Roku; Roku freed the prisoners and began destroying the island.

During this time, the Avatar tried to cross into Fire Nation territory to reach Roku's temple. Zhao ordered his ships to open fire upon the Avatar with no concern for hitting Zuko's ship, which was in pursuit of the Avatar at the time. Aang managed to pass the blockade, and presuming Zuko knew Aang's destination, Zhao allowed Zuko to pass the blockade and continue pursuing the Avatar. He tracked Zuko's boat to Avatar Roku's temple and, because he had been forbidden from re-entering Fire Nation territory, arrested Zuko along with the Avatar's companions. Aang was within a sealed chamber at the time, and Zhao waited for the Avatar to leave the main chamber to arrest him as well. However, due to Aang's contact with his past life and the spiritual power of the winter solstice, Zhao instead found himself confronted by Roku; Roku freed the prisoners and began destroying the island. Zhao managed to escape, but with no prince or Avatar, he attempted to save face by declaring all of the Fire Sages as traitors, despite their protests that only Shyu helped the Avatar."
