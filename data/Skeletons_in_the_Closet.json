Korra shares the sentiment, remarking that Amon has a knack of outsmarting them. However, Iroh remains hopeful in their eventual victory, trusting the second wave of reinforcements that are en route. He requests that a wire be sent to Bumi, Avatar Aang and Katara's first son and a commander of a division of the United Forces. He sends instructions to wait by Red Sand Island until the biplanes have been taken care of. After Gommu sends the dispatch, Bolin, Asami, and Iroh head toward the mountains to destroy the aircraft base; Korra and Mako, who had only been allowed to go after some arguing, on the other hand, go to Air Temple Island to find Amon and end him."
