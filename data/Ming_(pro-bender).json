Following their leader's signal, Ming and his companions left the restaurant.",

After being provoked by Korra's glances, Tahno stood up and confronted the two benders. Ming followed his lead and showed the same contemptuous attitude, though he and his friends left the talking to Tahno. However, when Tahno was scared off by Naga and reeled backward with fright, Ming intervened and caught his captain. Worried about his teammate, Ming tried to help Tahno, but he was pushed away by the team captain, who attempted to regain whatever dignity he could still muster. Following their leader's signal, Ming and his companions left the restaurant."
