Asami asked if Tokuga was planning to use knockout gas on mecha suits, but he told her he intended to use poison gas instead. Asami angrily refused, saying she would not let him hold the whole city hostage, but Tokuga quickly turned grabbed Wonyong and began strangling him using his tentacle arm. He told her she could either watch Wonyong die, or obey his offers. Asami shouted for him to let Wonyong go, agreeing to Tokuga's demands, as he called her a smart girl."
