If there is any type of problem it can be solved through the administrators, regardless of whether it's a HTML/wikitext/CSS/javascript question, a problem user or vandal, or bug. Why not to rollback users? Having rollback means the user is there to protect the wiki from vandalism. There isn't much logic to directing new users to those who have experience in removing vandalism when it's easier for them to catch an admin and less confusing. Do you see what I mean?
