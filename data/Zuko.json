After being adrift for weeks, Zuko and Iroh reached a Village resort, where they received an unexpected guest - Azula, who greeted them and informed them, that their banishment was at an end and that they could - finally - return home. Zuko believed his sister, and was ecstatic at the prospect of going home. Iroh, however, remained skeptical, as he had never known Ozai to forgive anyone.The next morning, the duo nearly boarded Azula's Royal barge when Azula's ship captain referred to them as prisoners, thus revealing the plan and enabling them to escape after a brief showdown. Zuko and Iroh were now fugitives and struggled to live off the land, even stooping so low as to panhandling for money. Zuko and Iroh started to drift apart and Zuko eventually said that they no longer had anything to gain by traveling together and parted ways with his uncle. Zuko wandered through the Earth Kingdom, passing through forbidding and uninhabited areas. Despite his worsening hunger and lack of supplies, he decided not to rob a young couple when he noticed that the woman was pregnant and eventually even helped and even saved Lee and the rest of his family and village from a bunch of Earth Kingdom soldier under the command of Gow, who abused their power. Despite what he had done for them, the townspeople rejected Zuko because of his identity (he revealed himself as a firebender) and he departed, alone, with his dagger, which he had forehand given to Lee as a present."

He mentioned the sight of his mother in the dream and his desire to find her, believing that it would solve his problems by connecting himself to a part of his heritage that was not murky and confusing for him. However, every search attempt up to that moment to find his mother had turned out empty handed. Zuko realized that he needed more information about what happened the day Ursa left, though he knew Ozai would never help him. Determined to find his mother, he turned to the only person who he believed could help him coax the needed information out of Ozai: Azula."

He also seemed quite at ease around the child, showing genuine friendship and politeness during their interactions, seemingly truly enjoying the girl's company. His caring feelings toward Kiyi only strengthened after he discovered she was his half-sister, and he disregarded any royal formalities with her."
