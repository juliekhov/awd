After trudging through the falling snow, Zuko found a cave, and took shelter. Soon after, Aang's spirit returned to his body. After the Avatar woke up, the airbender tried to escape but failed. Zuko restrained him, but Katara, Sokka, and Yue, who had been following them, come down on Appa. Katara defeated Zuko, and they prepared to leave with Aang. The young Avatar saved Zuko's life for a second time, insisting that Zuko must be brought along instead of being left unconscious in the snow where he would surely die. Upon returning to the Northern Water Tribe's city, Zuko eventually managed to escape and attacked Zhao for trying to kill him. After the battle had been won my the Northern Water Tribe with the help of the ocean spirit La acting through Aang, Zuko and Iroh escaped the North Pole and traveled on a driftwood raft for three weeks, until they reached land."

Overhearing Mai describe the kidnappers as Kemurikage, mythical spirits that kidnap children, Zuko decided to summon the Avatar. Upon Aang's arrival, Zuko, Mai, Kei Lo and Constable Sung brought him up to speed, before Ukano, Mai's father, barged into the meeting. Ukano insisted that Zuko enforced a curfew and assemble a task force to deal with the dark spirits to prove the Fire Nation's strength, but Zuko chose to defer to Aang's counsel to find out what happened to Tom-Tom. As he was being escorted out by Sung, Ukano declared Zuko an imposter to the throne, to which the Fire Lord recognized his voice and asked Mai if her father was involved in the New Ozai Society's plot against him, which she denied."
