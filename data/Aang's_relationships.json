They met again at Full Moon Bay, and she accompanied Aang and the rest of Team Avatar when they led several refugees through the Serpent's Pass. When she found out about Appa, she expressed concern for Aang and asked if he was feeling okay. When she discovered Appa hiding in a cave, Suki attempted to reunite Aang with Appa, only to be stopped by Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee. Aang and Suki met again when she escaped from the Boiling Rock."
