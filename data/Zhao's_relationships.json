Sometime later, the newly promoted Admiral Zhao employed the skills of a legendary squad of archers to trap Aang, only for the Avatar to escape from imprisonment with help from the Blue Spirit. When Aang was briefly being tutored by renegade firebending master Jeong Jeong, the admiral let a convoy of ships up the river to the hidden deserter's campsite and proceeded to attack both his former teacher and the Avatar. However, from Jeong Jeong, Aang had learned about Zhao's tremendous temper and lack of control, and the peaceful Avatar decided to use his knowledge against his foe by taunting him on until, careless with rage, Zhao's wild firebending destroyed the ships in his convoy. Aang subsequently left the admiral to stew on his defeat, as the monk had effectively defeated Zhao without having thrown a single punch."

As he was defeated by Zuko, Zhao stared in disbelief at the restored moon. At that moment, La, who had not yet reached the Oasis, emerged from one of the canals, grabbed Zhao from the surface, and began to pull him into the water. When Zuko saw this, he offered help by reaching out to him and telling him to take his hand. While Zhao at first made an attempt to reach, he decided he would rather die than accept help from Zuko."
