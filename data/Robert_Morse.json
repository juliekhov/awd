He was the second of Joseph Xavier and Edna Morse's eight children and mostly raised in Boston, Massachusetts, his family having moved there when he was one. When he was ten, his father died in a car accident and his mother, who suffered a nervous breakdown afterward, was committed to a mental institution in Florida. Young Morse and his siblings were subsequently sent to live with their maternal grandparents, John and Nancy Porter, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Around this time, unable to escape the stresses in his life, Morse would regularly make trips to the movie theater, seeing the new movies of the day and quickly developing idols in actors and directors.",
