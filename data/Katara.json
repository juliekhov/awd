Though she was cared for by her grandmother, Kanna, she invariably found herself filling the mother role left behind by Kya, even to her own older brother. As was the custom of the Water Tribe for women to see to domestic duties, Katara soon took on many of the responsibilities expected of an adult and quickly became independent and strong willed. Morally and emotionally driven, she developed a great sense of justice and compassion for others, becoming fiercely protective of those in need."

She and her brother set out to save Aang, who had himself purposefully arrested to save the village. After their successful rescue, she mused that they might find a waterbending teacher at the North Pole, to which Aang quickly brightened up, suggesting they could learn waterbending together, and the three began their journey to the North Pole together. During their journey to the ${link_5}, the group stopped in several locations in the now war torn ${link_6}. Their first stop was the ${link_7}, the original home of Aang, where the first signs of a deeper bond between Katara and Aang where shown, as she was able to calm the young Avatar after he came across ${link_8}'s corpse, which caused him to enter the ${link_9}. Next up, ${link_10} stopped on ${link_11}, where they were ambushed by the Crown Prince and barely managed to escape. After leaving Kyoshi Island, Aang, Katara, and Sokka flew to the great Earth Kingdom metropolis of ${link_12}, where they were brought before the elderly king of the city who treated them as royalty and threw a feast for them, but later imprissoned them. It was later revealed to them, that the elderly king of the city was none other than ${link_13}, a childhood friend of Aang. Before reaching the Northern Water Tribe, the trio encountered several other adventures, all the while being chased by both Zuko and his uncle Iroh, and Commander/Admiral ${link_14} of the Fire Nation navy. Among their countless missions, the team helped several Earth benders among them ${link_15} and his father ${link_16}, who were trapped on a Fire Nation ${link_17} to escape and unknowingly enabled the rebellion in that part of the occupied Earth Kingdom to ensue; helped the villagers of ${link_18}, who were being attacked by a spirit called ${link_19}; barely escaped the clutches of Zhao and Prince Zuko, an event, in which Katara lost her mother's necklace, the only thing she still had to remember her by; discovered the darker side of the resistance, when they came into contact with ${link_20} and his ${link_21} who tried to destroy a neighboring village of ${link_22} and kill all the Fire Nation civilians living there; helped two warring tribes, the ${link_23} and the ${link_24} to cross the ${link_25} and to reconciliate; encountered ${link_26}, one of her father's friends and warriors, where the unity of Team Avatar was put to the test; met ${link_27} who unsuccessfully tried to teach Aang the powers of ${link_28}, an event, in which Katara was wounded but discovered she had ${link_29} powers; and met and saved the refugees, among them ${link_30} and ${link_31} who lived in the ${link_32}, from a Fire Nation military force led by ${link_33} ${link_34}.",

The figure introduced himself as Aang, an airbender, and offered to escort them home on his Flying bison Appa. After her village was attacked by soldiers on a Fire Nation ship commanded by Prince Zuko, Katara learned that Aang was the Avatar. She and her brother set out to save Aang, who had himself purposefully arrested to save the village. After their successful rescue, she mused that they might find a waterbending teacher at the North Pole, to which Aang quickly brightened up, suggesting they could learn waterbending together, and the three began their journey to the North Pole together. During their journey to the Northern Water Tribe, the group stopped in several locations in the now war torn Earth Kingdom. Their first stop was the Southern Air Temple, the original home of Aang, where the first signs of a deeper bond between Katara and Aang where shown, as she was able to calm the young Avatar after he came across Gyatso's corpse, which caused him to enter the Avatar State. Next up, Team Avatar stopped on Kyoshi Island, where they were ambushed by the Crown Prince and barely managed to escape. After leaving Kyoshi Island, Aang, Katara, and Sokka flew to the great Earth Kingdom metropolis of Omashu, where they were brought before the elderly king of the city who treated them as royalty and threw a feast for them, but later imprissoned them. It was later revealed to them, that the elderly king of the city was none other than Bumi, a childhood friend of Aang. Before reaching the Northern Water Tribe, the trio encountered several other adventures, all the while being chased by both Zuko and his uncle Iroh, and Commander/Admiral Zhao of the Fire Nation navy. Among their countless missions, the team helped several Earth benders among them Haru and his father Tyro, who were trapped on a Fire Nation Prison rig to escape and unknowingly enabled the rebellion in that part of the occupied Earth Kingdom to ensue; helped the villagers of Senlin Village, who were being attacked by a spirit called Hei Bai; barely escaped the clutches of Zhao and Prince Zuko, an event, in which Katara lost her mother's necklace, the only thing she still had to remember her by; discovered the darker side of the resistance, when they came into contact with Jet and his Freedom Fighters who tried to destroy a neighboring village of Gaipan and kill all the Fire Nation civilians living there; helped two warring tribes, the Zhang and the Gan Jin to cross the Great Divide and to reconciliate; encountered Bato, one of her father's friends and warriors, where the unity of Team Avatar was put to the test; met Jeong Jeong who unsuccessfully tried to teach Aang the powers of Firebending, an event, in which Katara was wounded but discovered she had Healing powers; and met and saved the refugees, among them Teo and his father who lived in the Northern Air Temple, from a Fire Nation military force led by War Minister Qin."

At an Earth Kingdom stronghold, General Fong placed Katara's life in danger to induce Aang's Avatar State; but achieved only the destruction of his own fort. During their journey to Omashu, Team Avatar met with Chong, Lily, and Moku, and with their help passed thru a a labyrinth and reached Omashu, only to find that the city had fallen into Fire Nation hands. In the city, it was revealed that king Bumi had intentionally been captured and Katara and the rest of the team barely managed to escape the clutches of Azula, Mai and Ty Lee. Together the team got stuck in the Foggy Swamp, where each member experienced some sort of hallucinations, Katara herself seeing her mother. Afterwards the team visited Chin Village, where Aang was placed under arrest for a crime, which a past Avatar named Kyoshi committed and it fell upon Katara and Sokka to prove Aang's innocence and later helped save the village from the Rough Rhinos. After the earthbender Toph Beifong joined the group to teach Aang, Katara and Toph initially quarreled a lot, but after several encounters with Azula started to trust one another and eventually became friends. Along with the others and Professor Zei of Ba Sing Se University, Katara visited Wan Shi Tong's Library, where they learned valuable information regarding the War effort - the precise date of the Day of Black Sun. Katara proved vital in getting Team Avatar out of the Si Wong Desert, after Appa had been kidnapped by Sandbender Tribes and proved her worth even further, as she helped the team and some refugees pass the Serpent's Pass."

She was present at Zuko's coronation, after the team's successful victory in the century-long war. When she was later at the Jasmine Dragon, along with the other members of Team Avatar, she followed Aang outside after he had left for some fresh air, going on to hug him. She and Aang subsequently looked at each other lovingly before she instigated a romantic kiss."

Sokka mocked the Avatar, much to the annoyance of Katara, who asked him to stop as Aang's situation was serious, though when he would not let up, she ended his mockery with another snowball to the face. Their playful antics suddenly became serious when Azula had dived off Appa and set fire to Aang's glider, who had swooped down to save her from plummeting to her death, subsequently sending him crashing down on the ground. As they landed, Katara and Sokka quickly jumped off to tend to the downed airbender, while Zuko went after his sister."

When she asked him what he was doing there, she was told that he had seen Yangchen's spirit, though since he had been unable to communicate with her, he was attempting to contact her through meditation. Although she acknowledged that meditation was important to Aang, she reminded him that celebrations like the one they were supposed to be attending were something important too. Reminded of Yangchen's Festival by her words, Aang returned inside with Katara, where he alerted the three Air Acolytes, Xing Ying, Yee-Li, and Jingbo, as well as Katara and the other members of Team Avatar that they would go on a field trip the following day."

After reading the conditions of the letter, Zuko warned them that Gilak would cut the bridge with Kuei and Hakoda on it, even if they gave in to all of his demands. Katara was horrified, and commented at how evil Gilak's supposed plan was."

Katara expressed her concern that her trip home had not turned out to be anything like she had expected it to be; she had thought that now that the war was over their lives could go back to how they had once been. Sokka comforted Katara, saying that while he understood her, it was impossible for anything to be as idealistic as she had imagined because the war altered the tribe, even reaching back to Kanna's time.

While Aang had managed to grab hold of the three adults and prevent them from falling to their deaths, Katara fashioned an ice ladder to get to them. When Katara saw Malina sacrifice herself to save Hakoda, letting herself fall into the abyss, Katara rushed to her aid on an ice slide.

The whole thing ended with Toph dragging Katara away before things came to a head. Katara and Toph later went to a spa and reflected on how being a girl was not so bad at all."

During her encounter with Yon Rha, Katara created a large wide dome of water by gathering rainwater and created ice spikes from it, nearly killing him. Finally, during Sozin's Comet, she froze herself and Azula into a block of solid ice, thawed the center of it, and chained Azula to a grate."
