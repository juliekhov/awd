      "text": "Princess Mononoke (\u3082\u306e\u306e\u3051\u59eb, Mononoke-hime) is a 1997 epic Japanese animated historical fantasy feature film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki of Studio Ghibli. The design of Koizilla closely resembles the Forest Spirit from that film in its gigantic \"Nightwalker\" form. In the ending of Princess Mononoke, Lady Eboshi wanted to kill the Forest Spirit for the humans to triumph over the \"gods\", which may be similar to what Zhao wanted to do with the Moon Spirit. Ashitaka (i.e. Iroh) pleaded to her for peaceful coexistence between them and humanity but she severed the head of the Spirit anyway, while it was turning into the Nightwalker form. The head (i.e. Moon Spirit) was captured while the body turned into a blob form, (i.e. Ocean Spirit) killing everyone in his path while searching for his head. Ashitaka risked his life to return the head back to the body and end its the brutal rampage. The original story elements in the Siege of the North included the tragic story of Princess Yue's sacrifice to save her people and Zhao's willingness to die as a hero (rather live as a failure) to the Fire Nation; those were kept in the movie."
