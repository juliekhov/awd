Zuko ponders if Kei Lo is actually a double agent, angering him, and is reminded of how Kei Lo aided him in the forest. Zuko orders Kei Lo to be released, and Kei Lo tells him to accept he and Mai are together and move on. Aang arrives with Suki and Ty Lee, much to Zuko's surprise, telling him they found something he has to see. Mak tells him he needs to act before sun down, or else the citizens will rise again. Aang ignores Zuko's decision and takes him along with an air scooter. Suki, Ty Lee, Mai, and Kei Lo follow them. They arrive at the secret passage on the roof. Zuko asks Suki and Ty Lee to keep guard over the palace while they go through the passage, hoping to find Kiyi and Tom-Tom."
