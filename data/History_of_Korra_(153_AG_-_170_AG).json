After she called bending \"the coolest thing in the world\" and openly threatened to waterbend the protester off of his platform, the protester took advantage of her statements to rally the nonbenders against her and benders' oppressive nature and Korra retreated, leading Naga back onto the streets. Lost in the mazes of streets of the city, the Avatar halted to ask for directions. Her conversation was interrupted, however, after she noticed three members of the ${link_4} intimidating a local ${link_5}. Eager for a fight, she provoked and easily overwhelmed them, forcing them on the run. She thwarted their exit by catapulting their ${link_6} into a nearby shop with her earthbending. At that moment, the ${link_7} arrived and apprehended the triad members, but also charged Korra with destruction of private and city property. She attempted to flee to ${link_8}, but was subsequently caught by the ${link_9} officers and taken to the ${link_10}, where she was interrogated by a displeased ${link_11} ${link_12}.

In a local park, Korra came across an Equalist protester trying to rile up a crowd of nonbenders and convince them to join Amon and the Equalists. After she called bending \"the coolest thing in the world\" and openly threatened to waterbend the protester off of his platform, the protester took advantage of her statements to rally the nonbenders against her and benders' oppressive nature and Korra retreated, leading Naga back onto the streets. Lost in the mazes of streets of the city, the Avatar halted to ask for directions. Her conversation was interrupted, however, after she noticed three members of the Triple Threat Triad intimidating a local shopkeeper. Eager for a fight, she provoked and easily overwhelmed them, forcing them on the run. She thwarted their exit by catapulting their Satomobile into a nearby shop with her earthbending. At that moment, the Metalbending Police Force arrived and apprehended the triad members, but also charged Korra with destruction of private and city property. She attempted to flee to Air Temple Island, but was subsequently caught by the metalbending officers and taken to the police headquarters, where she was interrogated by a displeased Chief Lin Beifong. Although Tenzin managed to persuade her to drop all the charges against Korra, Lin made it very clear that she would keep an eye on the young Avatar."

For the first time in her life, Korra found herself afraid of something, although she refused to admit it. This fear held her back in her daily life, and when Councilman Tarrlok approached her with the offer to lead a special task force with him to take down Amon, she politely refused with the excuse that she needed to focus on her airbending training. However, Tarrlok persisted, sending her gifts such as a Satomobile, and throwing a gala in her honor. At the gala, several important figures living in Republic City attended as well as numerous journalists and photographers. Mako and Bolin attended as well, and Mako came with a date, Asami Sato. This moderately caused Korra to have feelings of jealousy, but she only got to speak to her friends briefly because Tarrlok approached Korra and tricked her into holding a press conference. During the conference, Korra buckled under the accusing questions of the journalists, the most troubling of which for Korra was a question if she was scared of Amon. To this, Korra loudly responded that she was not afraid of anybody, and stated that she would join Tarrlok's task force to help fight Amon, if that was what the city needed."

Falling unconscious, Korra had another vision of Aang fighting someone in the Avatar State with Toph alongside him. When she came, she and her teammates were tied to one of the support beams of the arena platform, but they were soon freed by Pabu who saved them by biting through the ropes. Korra immediately created a waterspout to give chase to Amon and the Equalists who were escaping through the roof. With the help of Lin Beifong, she managed to reach the Equalist airship and knocked off the Lieutenant and an Equalist before being knocked off herself. A battle between the four Equalists and Korra, assisted by Lin, soon ensued in which Korra mainly focused on the Lieutenant, whom she managed to overpower and knock off the roof. However, the strain of the fight was too much for the arena's glass dome and Korra fell through, but was saved by Lin. After she thanked the police chief for the rescue, Mako, Bolin, and Tenzin joined them and together they watched the Equalists escape, realizing that they were now officially at war with them."

He told Korra that he loved her, but she was too caught up in frustration and despair to say the same, so much so that she ran away on Naga, crying.",
