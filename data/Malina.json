As she waited, Katara and Sokka entered the office. After Hakoda stood and embraced his children, he introduced them to Malina and Maliq. Malina was excited to meet the two siblings, calling them \"celebrity heroes\". She was surprised to learn that Katara and Sokka had already met the men on her construction crew, and that they had had a confrontation about the lack of a fence around one of their active construction sites. After dismissing the crew from the office, she showed Katara and Sokka her plans for a new, large palace she planned to build for Hakoda, a building intended to serve as his home and office. She passionately declared that such a building would act as a statement to the rest of the world, causing the other nations to view the Southern Tribe as developing with the rest of the post-war world. She laughed when Sokka asked if they could build a slide in the middle of the new palace. Taking a liking to his fresh ideas, she offered him a position as a consultant on the construction crew, which he accepted. Maliq and Malina offered to take Sokka and Katara to dinner, and the former again heartily accepted their offer.",

As she waited, Katara and Sokka entered the office. After Hakoda stood and embraced his children, he introduced them to Malina and Maliq. Malina was excited to meet the two siblings, calling them \"celebrity heroes\". She was surprised to learn that Katara and Sokka had already met the men on her construction crew, and that they had had a confrontation about the lack of a fence around one of their active construction sites. After dismissing the crew from the office, she showed Katara and Sokka her plans for a new, large palace she planned to build for Hakoda, a building intended to serve as his home and office. She passionately declared that such a building would act as a statement to the rest of the world, causing the other nations to view the Southern Tribe as developing with the rest of the post-war world. She laughed when Sokka asked if they could build a slide in the middle of the new palace. Taking a liking to his fresh ideas, she offered him a position as a consultant on the construction crew, which he accepted. Maliq and Malina offered to take Sokka and Katara to dinner, and the former again heartily accepted their offer."
