      "text": "As the match begins, it immediately becomes apparent that the Wolfbats are not interested in playing by the rules. Tahno displays an obvious \"hosing foul\" against Bolin, but it is not called by the refs. Capitalising on this, the Wolfbats trip up Bolin by earthbending a disc under his feet and outside their zone which is again ignored by the referees, prompting even Tenzin to exclaim his outrage. Lin snarkily remarks that she would not have thought him to be familiar with the rules of pro-bending, to which he responds that Korra's participation had him brushing up on it. Thanks to the referees favouritism, the Wolfbats manage to push the Fire Ferrets back to zone three and eventually off the playing field. However, Korra manages to hold up herself and Mako on the edge of the ring with one hand. With an incredible effort, she tosses him back onto the playing field while letting herself plummet down into the water. Before landing, Mako knocks the celebrating Tahno down with a fire blast to the back, just as the buzzer sounds to end round one."

Korra suggests that if their opposing team is going to play dirty, they should do the same; however, Mako refuses to do so, as the only explanation for the Wolfbats ability to play as they were doing was that the referees had been paid off, and thus the Fire Ferrets would not be able to disobey the rules. Reluctantly, Korra agrees. After a fierce round two with some illegal ice moves and fire shot to the head by the Wolfbats, the round ends in a tie. The Fire Ferrets win the coin toss and Korra immediately decides that it would be a water against water battle. Tahno taunts Korra, inviting her to give him her best shot. He evades her seemingly lackluster blast, but the Avatar delivers another one with her foot, striking Tahno in the chin. The impact is so strong that Tahno's helmet is sent flying into the audience and caught by some ${link_0}, and he is knocked off the platform. In return, Korra taunts him by calling him a \"chump\".",
