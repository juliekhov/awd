One meteorite falls to Earth and impacts close by, starting a forest fire near a village. Fighting the fire, Aang and Toph begin to build trenches around it while Katara flies on Appa to a nearby creek from which she waterbends to dispose of the fire. Sokka, however, is merely placed in charge of Momo and does nothing to contribute, much to his dismay as even Momo manages to help out by snuffing more ember fires than him."
