With her company needing to make money, she went to see Varrick, who suggested that she sell her mecha tanks to the Southern Water Tribe to assist them in their war with the North. However, every shipment was intercepted en route. With the Metalbending Police Force assuming the Northerners to be behind the hijackings, Mako and Asami hired the Triple Threat Triad to guard a decoy shipment in hopes of capturing the real attackers in the act. However, when they were betrayed by the triad, they returned to Republic City to find all of the mecha tanks stolen."

In addition, they look somewhat similar to the lighter mechs from the Western Battletech series. The \"heavy\" visual design and wheeled/treaded legs also draw parallels to the Scopedog from the Armored Trooper VOTOMS anime series.\n Its reverse tricycle configuration could be compared to the Czar tank, a massive, experimental vehicle built by the Russians during the First World War."
