After telling an amusing story, he took notice of Mai's faint smile, stating that he was making progress since that was the second time that evening she smiled, though Mai denied having done so. He tried to tempt her with revealing a secret in order to get her to admit she had smiled. Curious, Mai complied and admitted she had smiled, and emphasized that it was a rare sight those days. Kei Lo stated that this was so because she had broken up with Fire Lord Zuko, leaving Mai to wonder whether she should be flattered or disturbed by Kei Lo's knowledge of her personal life."
