It would require a lot of coordination and cooperation with fanon groups, but I think we can get it done, and it would be a great addition to the wiki. The page would follow the same setup as the canon page, but would link to the fanon chapters where they appear or are featured. The only kink to work out that I see right away possibly is for canon species with fictional names, for example, the buzzard frog gets a mention but Steve the sky bison gets no love. Anyway, who's with me?DancePowderer Talk  05:44, June 25, 2013 (UTC)",

I just feel like right now it's not necessary and wouldn't actually contribute anything or help anyone to collect a massive amount of fanon pages' information and, again, who 'd be able to do it? Sparks also brought up some other excellent points about why that wouldn't work too well. The problem with following in pursuit of the second suggestion is that a majority of group fanon pages like Fanon:Shipping were agreed not to be kept in a forum a while back, excluding the shipping one due to its massive popularity, so I don't think we need to bring back another one of these pages even though we decided to keep them. Instead I think we should focus on bringing up all of the Fauna articles to an A-Class standard (if the standards council is still a thing, I'm not completely sure about it though). If not editing actual fauna pages, we could always expand our branches and look into flora articles, but if not that either I'm sure there's something that's well, erm, more productive than this?

I honestly don't believe that the task would be as daunting as you, and I am willing to help should you decide to create that page. From what I've read, many authors use non-hybrid animals, or hybrid animals from the canon 'verse. Sparks, just to refer back to your list - the best way, I think, to go through the fanon pages would be to go through the ones currently active, with active authors. That way, you are addressing the stories likely to be read, and are able to collaborate with the author(s). It wouldn't be just you, and I quite liked the idea of having it as a community fanon page, much like the shipping page. Your last point mentioned 'frequent updates', but I don't think there would be that many. The only story I can think of that has mentioned/introduced several new animals, and is likely to introduce several more is Heiress of the Nile. Also, many authors use the ideas from others (notice how the only alcohol is either cactus juice or fire-whiskey?). The hardest part would be getting the information, but with a community project, and very little to do, I don't believe it would be that difficult. And like I said - I'm willing to help out\u00a0:) Anyway, just my two cents. Frui (\ud83c\udf39 \u2022 \ud83d\udc1d \u2022 \ud83d\udc1d\ud83d\udc1d) 03:09, June 29, 2013 (UTC)",
