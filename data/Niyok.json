After the mining village was saved from an attack by the warrior spirit General Old Iron, Niyok's arm eventually recovered and she and Nutha rekindled their old bond with Katara. The three ate together and reminisced on their time in the South Pole, such as trying to eat Auntie Ashuna's seal jerky; Niyok laughed at Katara recalling the time she broke her teeth doing so. When the waterbender had to leave because Aang appeared upset, Niyok looked in his direction in concern before smiling warmly as Nutha remarked that Katara and Sokka made Southern Tribal citizens proud."
