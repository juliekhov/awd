He was discontent with Zuko ordering him to go find Aang, but since the prince threatened to burn the scroll he now had in his possession, the captain relented. After discovering that Aang was in fact the Avatar, he called off their deal, deciding that the bounty on the Avatar was worth more than the price of the scroll. Enraged by this betrayal, Zuko and his men attacked the pirates, who were quick to defend themselves while Zuko and the pirate captain faced off. The captain showed himself quite able to hold his own against a firebender, only defending himself with a sword. Their fight was cut short by Iroh, who alerted the captain that his ship had been hijacked. He lost his ship when it plummeted over the waterfall."
