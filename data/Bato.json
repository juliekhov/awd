Bato was Hakoda's best friend as a child and through him, Sokka and Katara felt a connection to their father that they had not had in years. The three talked and reminisced long into the night, leaving out Aang. Bato acted as somewhat of a surrogate father toward Sokka and agreed to take him ${link_1}, since Sokka never had the chance to with his own father. He also bore news of their father, stating that he awaited instructions on how to relocate him and the other ${link_2} men and offered to at least send word to the two of Hakoda's location as they accompanied Aang. However, in the comfort of their reunion, Katara and Sokka began to lose sight of where they were truly needed, as Aang began to feel betrayed and alone. Although at one point Sokka and Katara opted to accompany Bato on a journey to reunite with Hakoda, the siblings soon realized their duties to Aang and parted with the tribe member.",

Once Bato found them camping near the vessel, Katara and Sokka were elated to be around him, feeling almost at home again in his presence and his tent, which was decorated with furnishings from the South Pole. Bato was Hakoda's best friend as a child and through him, Sokka and Katara felt a connection to their father that they had not had in years. The three talked and reminisced long into the night, leaving out Aang. Bato acted as somewhat of a surrogate father toward Sokka and agreed to take him ice dodging, since Sokka never had the chance to with his own father. He also bore news of their father, stating that he awaited instructions on how to relocate him and the other Water Tribe men and offered to at least send word to the two of Hakoda's location as they accompanied Aang. However, in the comfort of their reunion, Katara and Sokka began to lose sight of where they were truly needed, as Aang began to feel betrayed and alone. Although at one point Sokka and Katara opted to accompany Bato on a journey to reunite with Hakoda, the siblings soon realized their duties to Aang and parted with the tribe member."
