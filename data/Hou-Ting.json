      "text": "Hou-Ting was temperamental, rude, and demanding, with a somewhat sour demeanor. Unlike her father, she held a low opinion of the Avatar due to Aang's part in taking the old Fire Nation colonies on Earth Kingdom soil and turning them into the United Republic of Nations. She was also deceptive and manipulative, promising to help Korra find airbenders in her city, only to later lie to the Avatar by claiming the reports were false. She was extremely possessive of anything she saw as hers, from her government's tax money to the captive airbenders, the latter of which she saw not as free individuals, but as property of the Earth Kingdom. She considered her opinion the sole truth that needed to be respected at all times and was willing to execute those who committed high treason, regardless of their age. Hou-Ting was also volatile, displaying outbursts of rage at the slightest provocation, from simple things like topiary placement or the presence of animals to more serious matters such as the escape of the Ba Sing Se airbenders from beneath her temple."
