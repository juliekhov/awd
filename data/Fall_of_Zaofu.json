      "text": "After Korra failed to win the duel against Kuvira for the fate of Zaofu, the military commander annexed the city to her empire and decorated its buildings with her banner. She demanded everyone to bow down and pledge their loyalty to her in order to be treated fairly as citizens of the Earth Empire, lest they would be imprisoned as traitors. Left with no other choice, the citizens bowed in fealty with the exception of Baatar and Huan, resulting in Baatar Jr. furiously denouncing them and ordering their arrest. Intending on distributing Zaofu's wealth over the kingdom, Kuvira ordered the metal protective barriers to be dismantled."
