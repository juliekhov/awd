While the inclusion of representatives from each continent should in theory have created an equal balance in power, this power was distributed among benders only. This was not always the case in the council, but the truth of bias among government officials was made an undeniable fact when four of the five councilmen incited a curfew for nonbenders because the council suspected they were all Equalists who would attempt to overthrow the council, a decision brought on by prejudice and mass hysteria. Most lower-class citizens appear to be nonbenders, as evidenced by the whole of the Dragon Flats borough, a place resembling a ghetto for nonbenders, being put under the curfew, suggesting everyone there was a nonbender."
