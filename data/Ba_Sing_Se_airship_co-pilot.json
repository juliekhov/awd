Although the test was a success, the co-pilot was forced to flee for his life lest he would be crushed by falling debris when a sand shark emerged from the sand and destroyed the ship, dragging most of it, supplies and all, underneath the desert's surface. As Asami suggested building a makeshift sand-sailer with the remaining scraps of metal, the co-pilot and his crewmates were ordered by the captain to gather up the material."
