Amon begins by sharing his life story with the audience, saying that he and his nonbending family lived normal lives on a small farm until they were harassed by a firebender. His father tried standing up to him and was cut down, along with the rest of his family. The firebender subsequently burned Amon's face, forcing him to wear a mask for the rest of his life.

Amon demonstrates this ability on the leader of the Triple Threat Triad, ${link_2}, causing his ${link_3} to slowly degrade into fire, and finally stopping it completely. With this, he declares that the era of bending has come to an end and that a revolution has begun.",
