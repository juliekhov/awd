      "text": "Upon arriving at the royal palace, Korra found several Northern soldiers tied up. After going to the upper level, she encountered a group of Southern rebels, one of them carrying an unconscious Unalaq. Korra attempted to negotiate the release of her uncle, but the rebels refused her offer and created a wall of ice for their escape. When Korra caught up to her adversaries, the rebel carrying Unalaq split from his group, who then proceeded to attack the Avatar. After dodging several water blasts, Korra tied up two of the rebels in a tapestry using airbending. She then knocked out another rebel with a kick to the stomach, and tied the last one to a pillar with his own rope. As the rebel carrying Unalaq attempted to escaped on a snowmobile, Korra created an ice ramp causing the vehicle to crash."
