They shared several kisses, although it was during their visit to Ember Island that Mai and Zuko had trouble with one another's anger or apathy and split up. Later, however, they were much more affectionate toward each another. During the Invasion of the Fire Nation, Zuko wrote Mai a letter detailing how he had to leave her and join Team Avatar.

Grey DeLisle, who voiced Azula, is known to ship Tyzula, as she once stated that \"Everybody knows Azula loves Ty Lee ...\""

The two soon became friends; he willingly showed her some pro-bending tricks and was quick to accept her on the ${link_2} pro-bending team.

His little gesture of kindness was overshadowed by the large gift basket the ${link_3} brought in name of ${link_4} ${link_5}. Bolin immediately inquired whether or not that \"Tarrlok guy\" was bothering Korra, as he was willing to have a word with him. When Korra laughed it off, saying that Tarrlok was just \"some old guy\", Bolin expressed joy upon hearing this, stating, \"That sounds better, I like that better.\" Soon after, Bolin talked to ${link_6} about Korra being his future girlfriend, saying that he and Korra would be perfect for each other. Although Mako was against it, Bolin asked Korra out and took her to ${link_7} for their date. They ate dinner, had fun, and took a trip to ${link_8}'s ${link_9} to gaze out over the city's skyline. Bolin bought Korra a bouquet of flowers the next day, but witnessed her kissing Mako, which reduced him to tears. Bolin's considerate, affectionate, and sweet treatment of Korra has strongly increased fan support for the ship.

Bolin convinced Toza to let Korra pass by after she sneaked into the Pro-bending Arena, and invited her back to the teams' locker room to watch the match. The two soon became friends; he willingly showed her some pro-bending tricks and was quick to accept her on the Fire Ferrets pro-bending team. After Korra helped to rescue Bolin out of the clutches of Amon, Bolin thanked her by giving her a cupcake and a rose. His little gesture of kindness was overshadowed by the large gift basket the council page brought in name of Councilman Tarrlok. Bolin immediately inquired whether or not that \"Tarrlok guy\" was bothering Korra, as he was willing to have a word with him. When Korra laughed it off, saying that Tarrlok was just \"some old guy\", Bolin expressed joy upon hearing this, stating, \"That sounds better, I like that better.\" Soon after, Bolin talked to Mako about Korra being his future girlfriend, saying that he and Korra would be perfect for each other. Although Mako was against it, Bolin asked Korra out and took her to Narook's Seaweed Noodlery for their date. They ate dinner, had fun, and took a trip to Republic City's Harmony Tower to gaze out over the city's skyline. Bolin bought Korra a bouquet of flowers the next day, but witnessed her kissing Mako, which reduced him to tears. Bolin's considerate, affectionate, and sweet treatment of Korra has strongly increased fan support for the ship. Though Korra ultimately entered a romantic relationship with Mako, the couple later split up, keeping hopes for Borra alive."

The ship, initially intended by the creators to become only a close friendship, became more hinted at during the last season to be developing into a romance. During the first season, Asami showed persistent goodwill toward Korra, which overcame the ${link_1}'s initial hostility, and refused to blame Korra for the difficulties she was having in her relationship with Mako. Korra, in turn, seemed impressed by Asami after she demonstrated her racing skills, to the point of apologizing for misjudging her. Further, in Book Three, the two girls expressed a strong friendship in which they both apologized for hurting each other in Book One. Asami became Korra's driving instructor and Korra even referred to Asami as a platonic \"girlfriend\", while expressing that Asami was the only good female friend she had ever had besides Naga. The two also engaged in friendly humor poking fun at Mako, as after he and Korra broke up he began behaving awkwardly whenever he was around either of them. Throughout Team Avatar's journey in search of new airbenders, and later during their interactions with the Red Lotus, Korra and Asami frequently teamed up together. While attempting to escape from the Red Lotus, Asami carried an unconscious Korra on Naga, and the two also worked together to escape a ${link_2} after being stranded in the ${link_3}. On the day of Jinora's anointment as an airbending master, Asami tended to Korra, who had been left weak and wheelchair-bound from ${link_4} poisoning, and offered to be there for her in case she needed to talk, \"or anything\", subsequently spending the rest of the ceremony at Korra's side. This showed the deep bond that the two girls shared, and also how much Asami cared for Korra. After defeating the ${link_5}, their relationship strengthened, with Asami helping Korra get around after the young Avatar was bound to her wheelchair. Despite Korra's return to the ${link_6}, they remained in contact via letters and although Mako and Bolin also sent letters, Korra only replied to Asami, stating that she felt that she could only confide in Asami about the hardships and fears she faced. The two reunited during lunch following Korra's return to Republic City. After sharing a quick hug, Asami complimented Korra on her new hair, prompting the latter to blush and remark that the engineer looked \"snazzy\" as always. After defeating Kuvira, they both attended Varrick and Zhu Li's wedding, where they took a moment for themselves. Asami said she could not have handled losing both her father and Korra in the same day. After Korra comforted her with a hug, Asami expressed her desire to take a vacation. Korra supported this and they decided to go into the Spirit World together, just the two of them.

In addition, Mike DiMartino shared the link to an article that had a section talking about the romantic implications of the scene and several people who have worked on The Legend of Korra admitted to shipping Korrasami, including ${link_7}, ${link_8}, ${link_9}, and ${link_10}. ${link_11} later confirmed through his Tumblr that the ship was canon.

When Korra and Mako first encountered, Makorra hints were present, causing the shipping to peak. The ship went viral once a promotional trailer showed a shot of Korra kissing Mako. ${link_0} and ${link_1} explicitly stated the fact that Korra has a crush on Mako, the two involuntarily fell asleep on each other at ${link_2}, and when the two posed as a couple to infiltrate Amon's rally to save Bolin, Korra was seen wearing Mako's beloved scarf. In fact, Mako's scarf has been a center argument for many fans, claiming it is similar to the \"${link_3}\", an idea in Eastern mythology that the gods might tie two lover's fates together with a red string so that they will meet and never separate. Furthermore, Korra is revealed to be jealous of Asami and Mako's budding relationship. When Korra admitted her feelings to Mako, he initially shot her down, but after witnessing her going on a date with Bolin, Mako expressed feelings of jealousy. When Korra later kissed him by surprise, he willingly kissed her back, complicating his relationship with Asami and his brother. Mako continued having an interest in Korra's welfare, as he was the first to hug her after she faced off against some Equalists and he was the one who attempted to carry Korra out of the ${link_4} when he could have carried Lin or Tenzin as well, but left them for his brother. After Korra was retrieved by ${link_5} after Tarrlok imprisoned her, he ordered the others to give her some space, picking her up and carrying her to ${link_6}. He proceeded to brush her hair out of her face tenderly, telling her she was safe. When Korra was recovering from her imprisonment, Mako was at her bedside and even held her hand. He even comforted Korra when she was upset about ${link_7} being taken over by Equalists. After Korra had lost her bending, Mako came to her and told her how he felt, telling Korra that he loved her. After Korra went into the Avatar State, Korra told him that she loved him as well. Mako and Korra subsequently kissed for the second time, this time mutually. Throughout Book Two, the two seemed to have a struggling relationship at certain points, but hit it off at others. However, once the pairing split due to the conflicted interests of Mako and Korra, some of the shippers abandoned the pairing. However, this was nowhere near the majority of the ship's fanbase, and many people imagine scenarios in which the two would reunite. The couple solidified their break-up after ${link_8}, kissing one last time and promising that they would always love each other. In later seasons, Makorra moments still appeared, but they were more subtle, mainly hugs and meaningful looks between the two characters rather than the previous kisses and outright love confessions. It remains very possible that Mako is still in love with Korra long after their breakup. When Wu asks Mako if he has a lady in his life, Mako looks down, almost regretfully, and replies \"No, not since Korra and I broke up.\" He also passionately talks about how much Korra means to him, and how she changed him for the better and continues to inspire him with her loyalty and bravery, even if they are no longer in a romantic relationship.",

During this interaction, Korra challenged him to a fight, calling him \"pretty boy\", before the Wolfbats' waterbender uttered: \"Go for it.\" This first interaction occurred while the Avatar was on a date with Bolin, when Korra saw that Tahno was staring at them. Tahno walked over to her and offered her pro-bending \"private lessons\". This single scene resulted in a constantly expanding fandom. Korra and Tahno also interacted when Tahno was at the police headquarters after he lost his bending. He wanted Korra to get Amon on his behalf, to which she nodded in acceptance. Their conversation ended with Tahno saying, \"See you around, Uh-vatar,\" with a smile."
