Aang and Katara began cutting completely through the braces using ${link_4}, but found the process was too slow to successfully disable the drill before the it broke through the wall. Aang stated that they did not need to cut through the braces completely and that just halfway through would be sufficient. Following this, he could deliver a final blow from the exterior that would destroy the weakened braces. Meanwhile, the crew found the drill worker that Katara had frozen earlier, prompting ${link_5} to investigate the situation along with Mai and Ty Lee. The gang fled as they could not fight and cut through the braces at the same time.",

Aang, Katara, and Sokka infiltrated the drill while Toph decided to try and slow it down from the outside, as she could not bend inside the drill due to a lack of earth. After stealing schematics for the drill from an engineer, the group headed for the outer shell of the drill where massive metal braces held the entire mechanism together. Aang and Katara began cutting completely through the braces using waterbending, but found the process was too slow to successfully disable the drill before the it broke through the wall. Aang stated that they did not need to cut through the braces completely and that just halfway through would be sufficient. Following this, he could deliver a final blow from the exterior that would destroy the weakened braces. Meanwhile, the crew found the drill worker that Katara had frozen earlier, prompting Azula to investigate the situation along with Mai and Ty Lee. The gang fled as they could not fight and cut through the braces at the same time."

Katara and Sokka managed to escape the machine by riding the slurry pipeline out the back of the machine.

Because the slurry was a combination of water and earth, both Katara and Toph were able to bend it from the outside and build up more pressure for when the final blow was delivered, thus leaving Ty Lee trapped inside.",
