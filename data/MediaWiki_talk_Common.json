I've copied all the codes mentioned here (not all at once, each with the way they should have been) and the titles aren't italic. Am I doing something wrong? If anyone can figure it out, leaving a message at the talk page of MediaWiki:Common.js there. The articles I am trying to get italic are Rio, Rio 2, Angry Birds Rio, Rio (video game) and Rio (DS Version) with only the actual title of the pages (in this case only \"Rio,\" \"Rio 2,\" and \"Angry Birds Rio\").",
