      "body": "With a flash of lightning, the camera cuts to Korra protecting herself from the Lieutenant's attacks, by having her arms crossed in front of her; she jumps backward out of his range. The Lieutenant surges forward. Cut to a side-view of the fight as Korra ducks under his wide swing. She retaliates by grabbing hold of his left wrist and kneeing him in the stomach with her left leg. The Lieutenant is swung around in a half-circle motion, and is slammed roughly on the glass ground behind her. Cut briefly to overhead view as he lands on the glass with a grunt of pain. Korra instantly retracts her left leg and prepares for a flaming half-moon kick. Cut to a frontal view of Korra as her kick reaches its zenith; the Lieutenant's left hand kali stick bounces away after he released it due to his fall. He manages to turn around to block Korra's attack by knocking her foot away with his other kali stick. The Lieutenant jumps up, during which he switches his remaining kali stick to his left hand, and attempts to kick her head, but she ducks. Korra attempts to hit him with two firebending punches, but he dodges them both. In slow motion, Korra narrowly misses with a firebending kick, and the Lieutenant prepares to strike back with his kali stick. Cut to a frontal view on normal speed of the Lieutenant as he brings down his attack. Frontal view of Korra as she narrowly dodges the weapon, before countering with an elbow to the face. Cut to a close-up of the Lieutenant as he is knocked backward, falls down and rolls over, before standing back up, albeit with the usage of his kali stick as support. Cut to Korra as she runs toward him with a determined look on her face. She twists around her own axis to build up momentum and launches two more firebending arcs at the Lieutenant. Cut to a point of view from the side of the arena looking up; the Lieutenant is flung off the roof and tumbles down it toward the water. Cut to Korra as she heavily lands on the glass, which cracks underneath her feet. Switch to her alarmed face as cracking sounds are heard. Cut to an overview shot at the moment the ceiling breaks and she falls through. As she plunges down screaming, the camera moves back to show Lin looking down from above.",
