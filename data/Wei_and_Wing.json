After they took out a guard on patrol, the twins and Suyin propelled up a tree with the aid of a metal cable. Overlooking the camp, Wing verified with his mother if she truly was certain that their plan to take out Kuvira would work, wary about the size of the army. Reassured that most soldiers had been forcefully enlisted and would have no reason to fight without their commander, the threesome infiltrated the camp, avoiding being detected by patrolling mecha suits and spotlights. After Suyin verified that Kuvira was alone in her tent by using seismic sense, they all tunneled their way into Kuvira's quarters. They were shocked to learn, however, that the sleeping woman was Zhu Li and realized they had walked into a trap when the sides of the tent fell back and they noticed they were surrounded by Kuvira's soldiers. They were all incapacitated by an electrical charge from a mecha suit and imprisoned in a metal contraption that prevented them from bending their way out."
