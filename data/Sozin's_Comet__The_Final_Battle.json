Roku instead tells Aang that during his own time as the Avatar, had he not spared the life of Fire Lord Sozin, the Hundred Year War would likely never have happened. Roku warns Aang that as the Avatar, he needs to be decisive. Aang becomes worried and contacts Avatar Kyoshi and Avatar Kuruk hoping they will support his choice, but both tell Aang that he must do anything it takes to bring balance back to the world. Hoping a fellow airbender would understand his choice, he contacts Avatar Yangchen. She tells him that as the Avatar, an airbender is unable to achieve spiritual enlightenment since their duty is to the world first before themselves. Aang concludes he has no choice but to kill Fire Lord Ozai."
