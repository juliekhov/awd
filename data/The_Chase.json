Together, the six of them (Katara, Aang, Sokka, Toph, Zuko, and Iroh) create a perfect perimeter in front of Azula and corner her. She surrenders, and Iroh relaxes his guard, turning to see his new friend, Toph, standing with the Avatar. Azula, taking advantage of this, fires at Iroh, who screams in pain as he crumples to the ground. Zuko lets out a horrified cry, and all four benders unleash their power on Azula, while Sokka throws his boomerang at her. The combined attack causes a large explosion, and by the time the smoke clears, Azula has disappeared.",
