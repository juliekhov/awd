She put restraints around the Avatar's wrists and ankles, revealing to Korra that the shackles were made from platinum, making any metalbending attempt useless. P'Li guided Korra toward the airship to return to the temple, but before they could board, Korra blew her backward with airbending, having been alerted that the Red Lotus had not kept their end of the deal. Upon noticing the arrival of Lin and Suyin Beifong, as well as Metal Clan reinforcements, P'Li told Zaheer to take Korra into the airship while she held off the metalbenders. She managed to pin them down behind the rocks surrounding the peak and nearly sent two of them plummeting to their deaths. When P'Li noticed Lin out in the open, she focused her efforts on taking down the Chief of Police. Just as she released her combustion attack that would have blasted Lin off the cliff, Suyin broke cover and metalbent her own cuirass around P'Li's head. The blast exploded upon making contact with the metal around her face, killing P'Li instantly."

Deeply in love with Zaheer, she displayed a protective streak when it came to him, as evidenced when she readily stayed behind to guard his body while his soul was still in the Spirit World and to hold back Lin, Suyin, and the other metalbenders to give Zaheer a chance to escape with Korra. In this capacity, she was also quite ruthless, having no qualms about firing her deadly beams at innocent people or children, as she showed no remorse when she apparently killed Kai.",
