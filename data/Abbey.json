To allow the nuns to live in solitude, none of the rooms have windows facing outward, and there is no entry to the abbey save through the main gate. At each of the four corners of the courtyard is a tower which is pierced with two windows on either side. A stream flows through the middle of the courtyard and feeds a small covered well. To the back of the courtyard is the large main hall, a multilevel building with deeply-curved roofs supported by wooden columns. Unlike the rest of the abbey's constructions, which are made of brick or stone plastered in warm tones, the main hall is wooden, with a half-timbered, white-plastered exterior.",
