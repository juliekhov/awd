The group follows it, finding Lian, Haru's friend Yuan and Hiryu, the waterbender who went missing from the Northern Water tribe. Haru demands Lian let Yuan go but Yuan states he is there of his own accord, helping Lian build the machines as he believes they are the key to winning the war. Lian confirms such, remarking her machines are the way to balance the world, not the Avatar. Sokka speaks out, citing replacing benders with machines would not balance the world or win the war. Lian rejects his proposal, stating the gang either join them or fight them, citing what they did to Zuko earlier. Angered, Aang defends Zuko's choice as the right one. Enraged, Lian unveils her new Avatar tank (dubbed the Ultimation) capable of manipulating air, water, earth and fire simultaneously. With no choice, the gang fights Lian's strongest machine."

Lian stops her machine's attacks, choosing to mock the group for how weak and exhausted they hard, citing Katara's defeat as proof her machines are stronger than benders. Overcome with anger, Aang triggers the Avatar state, proceeding to fight the Ultimation alone. With his enhanced airbending, Aang overwhelms the machine, smashing it to pieces. Exhausted, he exits the Avatar state, collapsing to the ground, knocked out. Defeated, Lian struggles to stand but Yuan and Hiryu help her up, conceding the human spirit is immeasurable while their machines have limits.
