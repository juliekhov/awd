After Korra realized that Katara was unable to restore her connection to water, earth, and fire, she became depressed. While Korra was at her lowest point, Avatar Aang's spirit appeared beside her and proceeded to restore her bending, transferring to her the knowledge of energybending at the same time. Korra later used the technique on Lin Beifong, effectively restoring her earthbending. During the following months, Korra also restored the bending of those victimized by Amon in Republic City, with the exception of Triad criminals."
