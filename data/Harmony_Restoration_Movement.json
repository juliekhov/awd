Assuming that the Fire Nation's sudden removal of their tank forces had crippled them, How ordered his troops to attack and reclaim Yu Dao; while Zuko's officers were initially caught off-guard, Zuko ordered them to defend the city's inhabitants. The two armies clashed, but neither side was able to gain an advantage. Enraged at the sudden upsurge of violence, Aang triggered the Avatar State and began to yell at Zuko until Katara snapped him out of it and convinced him to travel away from the chaos to a place where he could think clearly. There, Katara expressed her change of mind about the Harmony Restoration Movement, explaining that when she saw Kori's family that she also saw her and Aang's future as an Air Nomad and Water Tribe family. Katara later left to quell the violence while Aang flew away from the battle and consulted with Avatar Roku."
