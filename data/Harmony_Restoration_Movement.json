At the same time, Katara arrived back at the colony, and, after sweeping several ranks of earthbending troops aside, she used her waterbending to propel herself up to Earth King Kuei's war balloon. She convinced him to come down the city and see for himself the lives of the Yu Dao civilians that he wanted to change."

Believing Aang was there to kill him, Zuko removed his helmet, though the Avatar merely pushed the two armies onto either side of the chasm.

Bringing the two leaders together, Aang explained to Kuei that he was not only fighting the Fire Nation, but the Water Tribe, Air Nomads, and the Earth Kingdom itself.

Kuei realized Aang was right and went to inspect Yu Dao for himself. At the same time, Zuko also realized that the choice he had made was indeed the right choice and not the legacy of his father's hatred, causing him to faint. Aang spoke with Kuei after the Earth King had finished touring the city, and they agreed that, after Zuko had recovered from his ordeal, the Fire Lord and the Earth King would meet again to negotiate the future of the remaining colonies, as it was clear they could not belong to either nation.",
