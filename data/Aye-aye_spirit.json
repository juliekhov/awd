      "text": "The aye-aye spirit is spiteful of humans, believing that they are all \"ugly, destructive, and lacking any respect for nature\". Prior to befriending Wan, they were highly condescending and only eased on their actions after recognizing Wan's nobility and selflessness. Regardless, they considered Wan as an exception and remains largely hostile against other humans."

They also have the ability of possession, allowing them to temporarily take hold of a human body and control it as if the body were their own. This process caused a transformation in the human host, who was permanently left with some of the spirit's physical attributes. The aye-aye spirit can potentially kill humans by remaining inside their bodies for a prolonged period of time.",
