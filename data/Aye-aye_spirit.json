      "body": "As a spirit, the aye-aye is capable of teleporting over short distances and possessed much more agility and strength than an average human, having displayed the ability to overpower Wan in combat. They also have the ability of possession, allowing them to temporarily take hold of a human body and control it as if the body were their own. This process caused a transformation in the human host, who was permanently left with some of the spirit's physical attributes. The aye-aye spirit can potentially kill humans by remaining inside their bodies for a prolonged period of time.",
