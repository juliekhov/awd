      "text": "After wandering across many different terrains, Wan and Mula run across a large group of spirits running away from the all-powerful spirits, Raava and Vaatu, who are battling in a nearby valley. Wan goes to investigate and attempts to stop the fighting in order to protect the spirits and animals in the surrounding forest. Vaatu manipulates Wan and tricks him into using his fire to separate Vaatu from his counterpart, Raava. After Vaatu left the scene, Raava informs Wan of his mistake, telling him that he is the spirit of darkness and chaos and she, as the spirit of light and peace, had kept him under control for the past ten thousand years. Wan also discovers that the human and spirit realms are now headed toward annihilation because of his interference. Back in the present, Korra says that she has finally found Raava."
