Devising a plan to attack from above, she used Varrick's plane to create a diversion with Mako and Bolin, hoping it would provide Korra, Tenzin, Kya, and Bumi with the opportunity to enter the Spirit World. The plan failed, however, and everyone save for Bumi was imprisoned. After Bumi freed them all, Korra instructed Asami to fly a wounded Tonraq back to the healing huts, while the benders would enter the Spirit World in order to stop Unalaq from merging with Vaatu as well as finding Jinora's spirit. Asami remained at the healing hut with Katara, Tonraq, and Senna, watching over Jinora's body. When the young airbender awoke, Asami immediately inquired about the safety of her friends and was relieved to hear that Korra had saved the world."

At that point, Ghazan used his lavabending to block off the exit for the four, resulting in the hot liquid beginning to flood the temple. Asami was able to free the airbending master and asked where Oogi was, only to be told he had fled during the initial attack; he instead pointed them toward secret passageways out. She and Mako helped sustain Tenzin as they tried to outrun the lava with Bolin trying to block the flow with earth walls. They tried to sneak out through another passageway, only to be left at the mountain's edge and lava closing in on them. Bolin, however, saved them by bending the lava back and stopping its flow. At that moment, Kai arrived on his baby bison, Lefty, and led the group away from the collapsing temple."

Korra said she told her parents, but they had been very worried about outsiders' reactions.

Korra worried that if Kyoshi was unable to change people's minds, she would not either, but Asami assured her that times were changing, and people in Republic City tended to be very progressive and accepting of same gender relationships. The couple's discussion with Kya was cut off when they were greeted by Mako and Bolin; Kya begun to leave, but told the two that if they ever needed advice, she would be there.",
