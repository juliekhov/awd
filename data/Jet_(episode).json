Locating him suspended in a tree, Aang uses his ${link_6} to move himself toward the ${link_7} and free the ${link_8}. Discovering that the same fate had befallen ${link_9}, Aang readies himself to scale the tree again, though Sokka uses his ${link_10} to cut the cords and free the ${link_11} in one go. Examining the traps, Sokka determines that they were constructed by the ${link_12} and advises they leave quickly. However, he decides they should travel by foot, as ${link_13} is too easy to spot. Katara protests, opposing Sokka's notion that he is the leader, noting that if anyone would be their leader, it should be Aang, since he is the Avatar. Sokka counters by pointing out that Aang could not be their leader since he is just a \"goofy kid\", which Aang himself agrees with. Katara continues to tease her brother, musing that he would not be so bossy if he kissed a girl. Sokka is quick to counter that he already has kissed someone that Katara just does not know, causing her to smugly note that she has met ${link_14}. Quickly changing the subject, Sokka reiterates that his instincts indicate they should stick to walking as it increases their chances of passing through the forest unnoticed. Aang and Katara relent, though Aang soon grows frustrated over their slow progress and together with Katara, he starts to tease Sokka. Their banter is interrupted, however, when they accidentally stumble into the middle of a Fire Nation campsite.",

Aang, Katara, and Sokka soon notice he is missing and set out to find him. Locating him suspended in a tree, Aang uses his airbending to move himself toward the trap and free the lemur. Discovering that the same fate had befallen hog monkeys, Aang readies himself to scale the tree again, though Sokka uses his boomerang to cut the cords and free the animals in one go. Examining the traps, Sokka determines that they were constructed by the Fire Nation and advises they leave quickly. However, he decides they should travel by foot, as Appa is too easy to spot. Katara protests, opposing Sokka's notion that he is the leader, noting that if anyone would be their leader, it should be Aang, since he is the Avatar. Sokka counters by pointing out that Aang could not be their leader since he is just a \"goofy kid\", which Aang himself agrees with. Katara continues to tease her brother, musing that he would not be so bossy if he kissed a girl. Sokka is quick to counter that he already has kissed someone that Katara just does not know, causing her to smugly note that she has met their grandmother. Quickly changing the subject, Sokka reiterates that his instincts indicate they should stick to walking as it increases their chances of passing through the forest unnoticed. Aang and Katara relent, though Aang soon grows frustrated over their slow progress and together with Katara, he starts to tease Sokka. Their banter is interrupted, however, when they accidentally stumble into the middle of a Fire Nation campsite."

A soldier with an eye patch laughs at the bluff, though before he can say anything more, he suddenly falls to the ground, unconscious. Aang compliments Sokka, asking how he did that, to which a quizzical Sokka responds, \"instinct.\" Katara solves the mystery, however, by pointing everyone's direction to a young man standing atop a tree branch.
