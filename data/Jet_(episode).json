Locating him suspended in a tree, Aang uses his ${link_6} to move himself toward the ${link_7} and free the ${link_8}. Discovering that the same fate had befallen ${link_9}, Aang readies himself to scale the tree again, though Sokka uses his ${link_10} to cut the cords and free the ${link_11} in one go. Examining the traps, Sokka determines that they were constructed by the ${link_12} and advises they leave quickly. However, he decides they should travel by foot, as ${link_13} is too easy to spot. Katara protests, opposing Sokka's notion that he is the leader, noting that if anyone would be their leader, it should be Aang, since he is the Avatar. Sokka counters by pointing out that Aang could not be their leader since he is just a \"goofy kid\", which Aang himself agrees with. Katara continues to tease her brother, musing that he would not be so bossy if he kissed a girl. Sokka is quick to counter that he already has kissed someone that Katara just does not know, causing her to smugly note that she has met ${link_14}. Quickly changing the subject, Sokka reiterates that his instincts indicate they should stick to walking as it increases their chances of passing through the forest unnoticed. Aang and Katara relent, though Aang soon grows frustrated over their slow progress and together with Katara, he starts to tease Sokka. Their banter is interrupted, however, when they accidentally stumble into the middle of a Fire Nation campsite.",

Aang, Katara, and Sokka soon notice he is missing and set out to find him. Locating him suspended in a tree, Aang uses his airbending to move himself toward the trap and free the lemur. Discovering that the same fate had befallen hog monkeys, Aang readies himself to scale the tree again, though Sokka uses his boomerang to cut the cords and free the animals in one go. Examining the traps, Sokka determines that they were constructed by the Fire Nation and advises they leave quickly. However, he decides they should travel by foot, as Appa is too easy to spot. Katara protests, opposing Sokka's notion that he is the leader, noting that if anyone would be their leader, it should be Aang, since he is the Avatar. Sokka counters by pointing out that Aang could not be their leader since he is just a \"goofy kid\", which Aang himself agrees with. Katara continues to tease her brother, musing that he would not be so bossy if he kissed a girl. Sokka is quick to counter that he already has kissed someone that Katara just does not know, causing her to smugly note that she has met their grandmother. Quickly changing the subject, Sokka reiterates that his instincts indicate they should stick to walking as it increases their chances of passing through the forest unnoticed. Aang and Katara relent, though Aang soon grows frustrated over their slow progress and together with Katara, he starts to tease Sokka. Their banter is interrupted, however, when they accidentally stumble into the middle of a Fire Nation campsite."

Suddenly, Sokka arrives, riding Appa and accompanied by Momo. Jet is infuriated to learn that Sokka successfully warned the villagers of the impending flood and that the town was evacuated before its destruction. He tells them that, although the Fire Nation soldiers stationed in the city initially believed him to be a spy, Sokka's warnings were reinforced by none other than the elderly man that he and Jet had encountered the previous day. With the man's urgings augmenting Sokka's, everyone was safely escorted out of the village to safety. Jet calls Sokka a fool, believing that he has ruined the people's chance to win freedom from the Fire Nation; Sokka responds by coldly stating that there would be no one left alive to appreciate the freedom. Jet promptly declares him a traitor, but Sokka says that Jet became\u00a0the traitor when he stopped protecting the innocent. Katara turns her back on Jet, and she, Aang, and Sokka fly off on Appa, leaving the leader of the Freedom Fighters frozen to the tree. Aang and Katara apologize for not believing Sokka. While steering Appa, Sokka says to follow instincts, as they are usually right. Aang points out that he is flying in the wrong direction, and Sokka admits that sometimes instincts are wrong, changing direction.",
