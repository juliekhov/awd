      "body": "As anyone who has been a regular here for the last couple months will have noticed, I have become little more than a stranger in this wiki. Part of that stems from the scarcely available new information on Legend of Korra, and part (most of it) from my inability to withstand article comments, among other recent features. The recent wikia level changes seem to want wikis to turn into some sort of ill-idealized social network instead of the store of knowledge I once joined, where I would spend hours editing. I thought I had endured the worse when the canon and fanon merger was surprisingly smooth, but then came badges and article comments, and the wiki, in my eyes, began to value quantity over quality. I don't know how the Oasis skin has affected the wiki due to my absence during its implementation here, so other that tighter space and more visible \"edit this article\" links sprinkled through the article, so I hope it hasn't made people who shouldn't edit aware that they can't. Just because people can edit, it doesn't mean they should. Some of you have told me in the past that more users would be good for us. I'd be telling a blatant lie if I said I agreed. People go out of their way and start editing ludicrously just to get silly badges. Looking at the recent changes page, I see that now that many people simply go into articles and leave one-liner comments which add nothing to articles. The fact both article comments and talk pages are used at once makes it impossible as far as I'm concerned to filter through legit and relevant talks from the ones devoid of value. I would say that this is the thing that pushed me away the harder. The more has not been merrier, as it has brought editors of the kind I feel should limit their participation to being simple readers. I would say I'm an elitist as far as what I think the wiki should be about, I've never been coy about that. I still plan to edit the wiki once Korra begins, but I don't think I can ever edit the way I used to or feel the way I used to, because I don't think the wiki will ever be the way it used to. This wiki has been a very important part of me as an Avatar fan, which is why I feel need to type these words, both to get it out of my chest, out of my mind, and out of respect of my fellow editors and administrators, who I think should have a proper explanation for my absence and how I feel about recent events.
