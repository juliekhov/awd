Although I did take a rather long break from the wiki (more than a year), I am back and I  am here to stay (at least for some time), as I find working and editing on the Avatar Wiki to be a fun little side activity, which helps me get through University (especially now, that exams are closing in...). I have several ideas, which I would like to present and work on and hope that they'll be accepted. Also, I would like to immerse myself in anti-vandalism and general editing.
