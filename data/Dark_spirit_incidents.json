By that time, ${link_4}'s influence on the ${link_5} and the Spirit World began to grow exponentially, turning many spirits dark. Most of these dark spirits began to follow Vaatu's orders, and attacked members of the ${link_6} as well as sailors in the ${link_7} to give ${link_8} a chance to open the Southern ${link_9}. Vaatu's control was not absolute, however, as many dark spirits went out of control, both hindering Unalaq's plans and attempting to kill ${link_10} ${link_11}. Shortly before and during the ${link_12} in 171 AG, dark spirits were mobilized en masse by Vaatu to defeat those who threatened his plans. Most dark spirits were dissipated by Korra following Vaatu's defeat, but some remained, enslaved by ${link_13} to aid his plot to throw the world into chaos. Hundun's forces were eventually purified by Korra, and with Hundun's death, balance was finally restored in the Spirit World.",

By that time, Vaatu's influence on the mortal realm and the Spirit World began to grow exponentially, turning many spirits dark. Most of these dark spirits began to follow Vaatu's orders, and attacked members of the Southern Water Tribe as well as sailors in the South Sea to give Unalaq a chance to open the Southern spirit portal. Vaatu's control was not absolute, however, as many dark spirits went out of control, both hindering Unalaq's plans and attempting to kill Avatar Korra. Shortly before and during the Harmonic Convergence in 171 AG, dark spirits were mobilized en masse by Vaatu to defeat those who threatened his plans. Most dark spirits were dissipated by Korra following Vaatu's defeat, but some remained, enslaved by Hundun to aid his plot to throw the world into chaos. Hundun's forces were eventually purified by Korra, and with Hundun's death, balance was finally restored in the Spirit World."

The Avatar and Tenzin initially tried to defeat the spirits using regular bending attacks, though when they proved to be ineffective, Korra stepped forward and utilized Unalaq's purification technique successfully for the first time, fully pacifying these dark spirits. As their dark essence left the meditation circle, the environment's connection to the Spirit World was strengthened."
