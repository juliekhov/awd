Cuts to shot of his surroundings which are not that of the icy tundra, but a mystical swamp dotted with trees. A large white bird of some sort flies past. Cuts to shot of Aang as the bird flies over the screen; he stands and begins wandering about. Cuts to shot of a figure in the distance sitting beneath a simple wooden entranceway. The figure can be heard uttering the sound \"Ohm\". Aang appears on-screen, turns his head in the direction of the sound and begins making his way toward the figure. Cuts to side-view of the figure, a monkey-like creature, as Aang approaches him, before cutting to a shot of the two with the figure's back to the camera.",

Close-up shot of Aang and La as the latter's eyes light up. Side-view of Aang as he descends into the water. Wide shot of the whole oasis as blue lightning-like energy expands from the oasis island into the water. Wide shot of the Water Tribe city as the oasis begins to light up in the same blue color. Cut back to Katara and the others watching. The energy moves to the edge of the oasis, rising up to form a giant amphibious-like creature, facing out toward the sea, with Aang in the center, controlling it. Cut to the Fire Nation soldiers in the city looking on at this creature's sudden appearance. Cut briefly to Pakku and other Northern Water Tribe members before changing to a view of Aang moving past a river, Fire Nation soldiers on one side, Pakku and his group on the other. The Water Tribe all bow down as the Fire Nation soldiers prepare to attack. Aang, controlling the massive creature, begins to head to the ocean, laying waste to any Fire Nation soldiers on the way.",
