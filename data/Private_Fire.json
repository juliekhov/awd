Aang, Katara, and Toph prove to the leader, who they overhear does not believe Sokka's claims, that \"spies\" are there by bending at the soldiers. Since the base leader is too stunned to give his soldiers any commands, Sokka takes it upon himself to march alone into the cave. After the team escapes through the back of the cave on Appa, a cave in occurs thanks to Toph's earthbending. The leader, having had a change of heart upon witnessing Private Fire's apparent demise, sees personally that his memory lives on, arranging a memorial in his honor."
