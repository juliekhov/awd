Many of them are also partially starved. The zookeeper explains to Aang that the zoo is no longer receiving funding from the Dai Li because it is no longer popular with the children. However, in a circle of troubles, the zoo is also quite filthy; one of the cages shows an animal lying near multiple piles of feces. The keeper would like nothing more than to let his animals run wild in open spaces, and Aang suggests moving the animals to an open area just outside the city."

When he is suddenly awoken by a clap of thunder, he instinctively hides in Sokka's bag. When he emerges, he finds a tuft of Appa's hair on his head from inside the bag. Smelling it, Momo realized that the fur is Appa's. Seeing an Appa-like shadow on the ground, he wraps the fur around his wrist and takes off after it, only to find a lone cloud. A similar sighting only turns out to be a cherry tree."
