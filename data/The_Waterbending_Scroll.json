Commenting on the pirates' success, Zuko approaches them with the waterbending scroll. Katara tries to apologize to Aang, claiming responsibility for their situation, though Aang brushes it off. Zuko and the pirates try to make the trade, scroll for Avatar, though neither side wants to exchange their collateral first. Sokka subsequently asks the pirates if they really are going to hand over the Avatar for a \"piece of parchment\". As they are surprised by the revelation that Aang is the Avatar, Sokka adds that they could likely make more money trading Aang on the black market or by handing him over to the Fire Lord himself than by exchanging him with Zuko for one scroll. Convinced, the pirate captain calls off the deal, telling Zuko to keep the scroll as he turns and walks away from the firebender. Outraged, Zuko and his soldiers attack the pirates."
