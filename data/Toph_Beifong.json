Aang failed to enlighten the group to the reasons behind the festival, brushing off the inquiries to the identity of the woman depicted by the statue to which they would be bowing by stating that that was just how things were done, reminding Toph of her childhood during which her father had used exactly the same reasoning to justify every rule and action he imposed on her. For this reason, she subsequently refused when Aang asked everyone to bow, stating that she bowed to no one, and ended up denouncing the festival entirely as unimportant when he tried to convince her to participate regardless of a lack of detailed reasoning."

Noticing Ty Lee sitting nearby, Toph greeted her with a punch on the arm, briefly cheering up the young chi blocker. Asking if she should not be training, Toph learned that Ty Lee needed a break as nothing felt right to her anymore. Believing to know what was needed to \"punch [her] aura back in place\", Toph dragged her friend off to the Fire Nation circus. There, Ty Lee immediately became excited, prompting Toph to question why she never went back to being a circus acrobat. While Ty Lee was explaining, her old circus master pushed her into a nearby tent, and following her, Toph quickly became startled upon seeing \"a whole bunch of [Ty Lees]\". Ty Lee introduced her to her twin sisters, with whom she had long lost contact. After the family reunion evolved into an argument, causing a frustrated Ty Lee to storm out of the tent, Toph tried to cheer up the chi blocker by saying that she was her favorite out of all the Ty sisters. She also convinced a still annoyed Ty Lee to stay at the circus and attend a performance to show support for the platypus bears."

      "text": "In the following two days, Toph resumed her old habits of passing her time by relaxing. When Korra asked about their plans for the third day, Toph hinted that she wanted to continue doing nothing. This was not entertaining enough for the restless Avatar, who asked the elderly woman to retell the story of how she taught Aang to earthbend. Toph dismissed the question as there was no story there, considering she merely \"threw some rocks at the Avatar, he got all whiny, and Sokka fell in a hole\". As an excited Korra asked to hear the story about how Team Avatar had taken down the Fire Lord, Toph grew annoyed and relayed the story in a few sentences, saying that \"it was hot. [She] was on a blimp. And [she thought] a giant turtle showed up.\" Upon being berated for being a terrible storyteller, she defended herself by declaring Korra to be a terrible listener. Although Toph tried to resume relaxing, she grew irritated by Korra restlessly tapping her foot on the floor. Raising the earth underneath the Avatar's feet to stop the tapping, she ordered the young woman to leave and collect some mushrooms for dinner, giving her directions as to where to go."

Warning everyone that the guards were on the other side of the door at the opposite side of the chasm, she noted that they had to be quiet, lest they would be discovered. With Bolin's help, she catapulted Lin atop the wooden cell, so she could swing back all the prisoners on her cable and Bolin could catch them. Everything went well, until the acrophobic Baatar inadvertently alerted the guards to their presence. Despite this setback, they managed to free the entire family and Toph warmly hugged her youngest daughter, before they all made their way back to the surface and reunited with Opal. When Bolin declared he would save Zhu Li at the abandoned town that was to be blown up by the cannon, Toph stated that he did not know for sure that she was on their side as she could have been lying before to cover up a mistake she had made as opposed to deliberately sabotaging the machine as Bolin believed. After he and Opal left anyway, Toph declared to be through with fighting and refused to join Lin, Suyin, ${link_0} in their attempt to stop Kuvira. She stayed behind with Baatar and ${link_1}, though when the former tried to make smalltalk, addressing her as \"mother\", she quickly shut him down by reminding him that he should never address her as such. Despite her initial refusal, Toph ultimately interfered in the battle when the foursome found themselves outnumbered and surrounded and saved them by shifting the earth underneath all their opponents, bringing them down.

Warning everyone that the guards were on the other side of the door at the opposite side of the chasm, she noted that they had to be quiet, lest they would be discovered. With Bolin's help, she catapulted Lin atop the wooden cell, so she could swing back all the prisoners on her cable and Bolin could catch them. Everything went well, until the acrophobic Baatar inadvertently alerted the guards to their presence. Despite this setback, they managed to free the entire family and Toph warmly hugged her youngest daughter, before they all made their way back to the surface and reunited with Opal. When Bolin declared he would save Zhu Li at the abandoned town that was to be blown up by the cannon, Toph stated that he did not know for sure that she was on their side as she could have been lying before to cover up a mistake she had made as opposed to deliberately sabotaging the machine as Bolin believed. After he and Opal left anyway, Toph declared to be through with fighting and refused to join Lin, Suyin, Wei, and Wing in their attempt to stop Kuvira. She stayed behind with Baatar and Huan, though when the former tried to make smalltalk, addressing her as \"mother\", she quickly shut him down by reminding him that he should never address her as such.

      "text": "Toph's proclamation of being the most powerful earthbender in the world is supported by her talented displays of earthbending since a young age. Although blind, Toph's training in earthbending under the original earthbenders, the badgermoles, allowed her to use their unique ability of seismic sense: she used earthbending to \"feel\" even the most minute vibrations in the earth, including the march of ants several meters away and the presence of trees and buildings. Through this heightened seismic sense, Toph could visualize where people were, their relative distance to her, and their physical build, but was unable to visualize faces. This sense provided her with a distinct advantage when facing other earthbenders in combat, because she could predict attacks as they began and quickly react. Her knowledge of the art also allowed her to teach it to others like Aang, and later her daughters, Lin and Suyin. Her speed and agility were also greatly beneficial in combat."

This style greatly differentiated from the rigid training and fighting style that earthbenders like the Dai Li implemented. Toph's style tended to be proven to be superior to the Dai Li, as she was able to take on a number of them and defend her friends at the same time. This is likely because while the Dai Li just manipulated the earth, Toph had established a tremendously deep connection to it at the very outset of her self-tutelage in earthbending (although both styles have an over dependence on something i.e. the Dai Li and their earth gloves and Toph and her feet).",
