She, Mako and Bolin rode a biplane in the assault. Bolin earthbent a number of explosives against mecha tanks and remotely detonated them; he remarked that if Varrick were there, they'd be able to caption Nuktuk as a sky hero. Soon Desna and Eska joined the fighting and crippled the trio's biplane, causing it to crash, and captured them. They were soon freed by Bumi, Naga, and Pabu, and they continued onto the spirit portal. As Korra devised a plan to stop Unalaq and Vaatu, Bolin asked whether they'd face a worst-case scenario where she fails and they all get trapped in the Spirit World, the Avatar said that it'd be an honor to fight beside them. They then entered the Spirit World. While Tenzin, Kya and Bumi went searching for Jinora, Mako, and Bolin fought against Unalaq while Korra closed the Southern portal. Ultimately, the brothers were beaten, as the Harmonic Convergence freed Vaatu from the Tree of Time."

The two brothers briefly held off the Northern Chief for a time before being ambushed by Desna and Eska, enabling Unalaq to re-enter the portal. The brothers managed to escape and followed the waterbender back through the portal, but they barely made a few steps before being encased in ice by the twins, and thus helplessly witnessed Unalaq succeed in merging with Vaatu, becoming the ${link_0}. While Mako failed to reason with the twins, Bolin, emotionally distraught about the end of the world, admitted his regret over not marrying Eska. Shocked by this, Eska demanded to know why Bolin ran away, to which he simply stated he was afraid of his feelings. Finding Bolin's words true, she kissed him and let the brothers go free. While Mako believed it to be an act by Bolin, Bolin realized that he truly meant it all. They returned to the physical world and rushed to aid Korra as the Dark Avatar ripped the light spirit ${link_1} right out of her, but were too late to save the light spirit. As they helped Korra up, the three were witness to Unalaq transforming into a massive dark spirit and reached toward the spirit lights and vanished, causing a shockwave that knocked them out.",
