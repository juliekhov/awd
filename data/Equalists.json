After he was eventually exposed as a waterbender who used bloodbending to sever the connection to one's bending art, the Equalists lost much power and many supporters, but remnants of the group kept a low profile in Republic City underground, rebuilding their strength. After Harmonic Convergence, the remaining Equalists came into contact with a mysterious man named Hundun, who promised them a new world order, free from bending. The revolutionaries decided to side with him, but were eventually defeated by Avatar Korra once again."

As a result, the Equalists disguised themselves as ordinary spectators and entered the arena that night. After the match, they sprang into action, electrifying several members of the Metalbending Police Force who were present as part of a security detail, Tenzin, Lin Beifong, and the Fire Ferrets. As they appeared on the playing field, the still present White Falls Wolfbats attacked them, but Amon easily evaded their attacks and took their bending away. The Equalists kept the arena secured as Amon declared war on all the benders, before blowing up the playing field. As they escaped on their airship, Korra came after them. With the aid of Lin, she managed to knock some Equalists off the cables suspended underneath the airship, but was soon knocked off herself. A fight ensued on the arena's roof between Korra and Lin against four Equalists, among whom was the Lieutenant. Lin immobilized two of them with her metalbending, and Korra knocked out the other one and even threw the Lieutenant off the roof, but Amon and the remainder of his cronies escaped."

While the militant sect of the Equalist revolution was greatly weakened as result and was to blame for much damage to Republic City, they did force a worldwide dialogue about the representation of nonbenders. In the United Republic, that led to the non-elected United Republic Council dissolving itself and the holding of democratic elections. As a result, a nonbender, Raiko, was elected by the nonbending majority. Despite this, however, a remnant of militant Equalists chose to continue resistance and went into hiding to avoid detection for the following six months."
