Due to the signs of a possible war, Aang was told about his status as the Avatar at age thirteen, three years earlier than usual. This caused a schism between himself and the other Air Nomads of his age, and shortly after running away from his nation due to his reluctance to be the Avatar, Aang and his flying bison, Appa, were caught in a storm, crashing into the water and being swallowed by the waves. Aang saved himself and Appa while semi-conscious by entering the Avatar State, freezing the two in a sphere of ice by using a combination of airbending and waterbending."

The tattoos are along the chi-lines as with his animated counterpart, except for a \"cross-like\" figure between his shoulder blades on his back. At the Spirit Oasis, Aang revealed that to receive the tattoos, an airbender must be able to meditate for long periods of time without losing focus, presumably as a mark of graduation, rather than after mastering thirty-five of the thirty-six tiers of airbending and inventing a new airbending technique like the \"air scooter\" in the series. In the BR/DVD featurette, Discovering The Last Airbender, Bryan Konietzko said he suggested that the tattoos, which were solid lines in animated version, be made more intricate for the live-action version."

He is also extremely agile and quick. Frequently, he can defend himself without bending by simply dodging and avoiding attacks.

Aang can use his glider staff too with great skill, using it sometimes for attack, defense, or bending.",
