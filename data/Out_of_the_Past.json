As Lieutenant opens the box finding what seems to be an unconscious Korra, the Avatar attacks them with firebending and incapacitates them with earthbending, allowing her to escape. She rushes out of the cabin and, from a distance, manages to get a glimpse of Amon abducting Tarrlok. Korra waterbends sharp icicles at Amon to give her time to escape. She slides down the mountain with Amon overlooking from behind and reprimanding the Lieutenant about their underestimation of her."
