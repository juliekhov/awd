Bolin tells her that they had in fact kissed once during the ${link_2}, but that it is \"no big deal\" and she has nothing to worry about, much to her dismay. Asami is not convinced by Bolin's reassurance and becomes saddened. The group spots two Equalists on motorcycles entering a secret passage and follow them.

Scanning the prison with her seismic sense, Lin Beifong finds and frees her officers, though learns that they have already lost their bending. In the hallway, Mako angrily interrogates an Equalist about Korra's whereabouts, threatening him with his firebending, only for the man to tell him that they neither have the Avatar nor attacked City Hall, and that Tarrlok is lying.
