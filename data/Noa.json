Noa and Kam combined their bending to merge Katara's snowballs into one large ball and launch it back at her, declaring that she was apparently the one in need of a lesson. Katara, however, easily stopped the ball from crushing her, gave it dangerous spikes and intended on throwing it at the three construction workers. Frightened by the sight, Noa surrendered and reasoned with Katara that they only intended on scaring the children, not hurt them. They trio quickly retreated back inside the half-finished building afterward, leaving Katara and Sokka to lead the children out of there."
