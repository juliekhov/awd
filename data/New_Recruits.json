      "text": "The new characters in this comic were winners of a Nick Magazine contest in which readers designed their own Avatar characters. The contest ran from sometime in September 2006 to September 19 of that year. According to an advertisement by Nickelodeon, the winners were to receive a framed copy of the comic and ten copies of the issue, as well as \"other great Nick prizes\". Rules for the competition were simply that the characters have special skills.\n Nickelodeon advertised that \"the 3 best characters created\" would be drawn into the comic, yet five characters by five illustrators were featured in \"New Recruits\"."
