      "text": "Kuvira continued her quest to stabilize and reunite the Earth Kingdom and, by 174 AG, she had reunited ninety percent of the nation with military force, earning her the nickname \"Great Uniter\", though many saw her as a conqueror. To stabilize the conquered areas in the long term, Kuvira's forces initiated a secret purge of dissidents, political enemies and citizens of non-Earth Kingdom origin, sending them into prison-like reeducation camps. One of the last states to oppose her was Yi, though it too submitted to her rule after bandits threatened to starve the state's population. With the country largely pacified and the anarchy effectively ended, Prince Wu was set to be crowned king and return to the Earth Kingdom capital, having taken refuge in Republic City until his nation could be stabilized. His ascension was supported by international powers but opposed by Kuvira and her followers."
