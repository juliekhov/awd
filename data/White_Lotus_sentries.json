They launched a barrage of firebending, earthbending, and waterbending attacks, and, with the help of Lin Beifong and Tenzin's children, eventually defeated the invaders. On orders from the former Chief of Police, they locked the captured Equalists up in the temple's basement. The tides quickly changed, however, when more airships made their way over from the mainland and deployed more Equalists on the island, prompting the residents to prepare for a quick departure. To allow Avatar Korra and her friends enough time to escape the island, four sentries remained behind to thwart and delay any possible pursuit of the Avatar by Equalists forces."
