After Appa proved to be too much to handle, he traded the flying bison to some beetle-headed merchants who were planning to take him to Ba Sing Se and sell him on the black market. As the sandbenders began to take off, Appa started shaking the merchants' transport trailer, to which Ghashiun mockingly replied that he was now the merchants' problem, laughing as he and his group left."
