She informed him of the damage that had taken place to the Avatar Spirit and explained how to return to his body, further instructing him to seek out the past four Avatars while avoiding Koh the Face Stealer. She appeared to Aang once more to encourage him not to lose hope and to continue fighting. She subsequently assisted him in his impressive feat of waterbending to get himself to safety, utilizing her powers as the Moon Spirit."
