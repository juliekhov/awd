When Asami proposed to work together to repair the airship, the captain denied the request, stating that the ship nor the girls were going anywhere, as the women were still in their custody and they had a duty to transport them to the Earth Queen. Even when Korra warned him about the dangers of fighting the Avatar, he would not budge in respect of the orders he had been given. When Asami believed she saw a sand dune moving, the captain dismissed it as a typical mirage one would see in the desert. However, they soon realized there was something lurking beneath the sand and, under the pressure of his crew, the captain relented and gave the order to repair the ship."

Although the test was a success, the captain was forced to flee for his life lest he be crushed by falling debris as a ${link_0} emerged from the sand and destroyed the ship, dragging most of it underneath the desert's surface. The captain calmed down ${link_1} when the soldier began to panic due to the loss of their supplies, reminding him of the rescue ship that was a few hours from their location. He grew agitated by Asami's claim that they may not have that time to spare and briskly told Korra that they were out of walking distance of the desert's border, before ordering a still-panicked Arik to get a hold of himself. Upon Asami's suggestion to build something to provide them all with an escape out of the desert, he sarcastically asked if she wanted to make metal wings and \"flap real hard\". However, hearing her suggest constructing a makeshift sand-sailer out of the ship's remaining material, the captain consented and promptly ordered his crew to gather all the metal they could find among the wreckage, adamant about not being an easy target for the sand shark.",
