The occupation was not welcomed by the Southerners, who had already resented Northern rule for many years and felt that Unalaq's actions threatened their sovereignty. Eventually, these tensions boiled over when Team Avatar broke a group of rebels out of prison after learning that Unalaq had not only fixed their trial, but also organized the barbarian invasion of the North that led to Tonraq's banishment. This event officially ignited the Water Tribe Civil War. Unalaq used the chaos of the conflict to prepare for the Harmonic Convergence, during which he freed Vaatu and merged with the spirit. The Northern troops were eventually defeated and Unalaq killed, ending the civil war with the South's victory. Soon after, Avatar Korra declared the Southern Water Tribe independent from the North, and Desna and Eska, Unalaq's children, returned to their tribe to rule in their father's stead. Two weeks after Harmonic Convergence, P'Li escaped prison with the help of the Red Lotus."
