      "text": "In the aftermath of the Hundred Year War, Team Avatar, led by Avatar Aang and Fire Lord Zuko, came to an agreement with Earth King Kuei on the establishment of the Harmony Restoration Movement, which aimed to return Fire Nation colonies to the control of the Earth Kingdom. One of the consequences of this action was the removal of Fire Nation citizens from the settlements that they had created over the past century. This forced departure had considerably negative demographic consequences unforeseen by the parties in the agreement, such as compromising biracial denizens with both Fire Nation and Earth Kingdom heritage, and destroying the prosperity the colonies were experiencing due to the efforts of citizens from both nationalities. A year into the operation of the movement, Zuko withdrew his support after being accused of being a traitor by the mayor of the first colony, Yu Dao, precipitating a confrontation with Aang."
