They look up and the scene switches to the two masked motorcyclists, who elegantly twist in the air to land at opposite sides of Mako and Korra to fight them, who at this point, have gotten up. The female rider wastes no time and runs for Korra, who ignites her right fist and sends a large fire blast at the incoming attacker. Frontal shot of the female as she elegantly avoids the blast by jumping over it, twisting several times in the air, and continues her run for the Avatar. Side shot as she initiates a hand-to-hand combat with Korra. The chi blocker aims for Korra's head, but the Avatar averts the course with her left hand. She retaliates with a fire blast, which her opponent ducks under. The camera rapidly turns around them when the chi blocker locks arms with Korra. The Avatar throws another fire punch with her left hand, but the chi blocker leans back to dodge it, knocking Korra's hand to the side. Korra uses her sideways moment to spin around in a full moon fire kick, though the masked fighter evades the blast by moving to her left. Camera turns again and stops at a side shot when Korra aims a high fire kick at the chi blocker's head, who reciprocates that move and curls her leg around the Avatar's and pulls it down, creating an unguarded opening to Korra's right side. She delivers about four punches to the Avatar's side and arm and backs away. Frontal shot as Korra staggers with a grunt, as her right side has gone numb. She grabs hold of her right arm with her left one, her eye big in wonder about what just happened to her.",
