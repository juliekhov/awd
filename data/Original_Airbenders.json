Unfazed, he attempts to continue, but is interrupted by Bumi, who entertains his fellow students with Bum-Ju's help by imitating a spirit. Following his lecture, Tenzin guides Oogi through the air, amazing the recruits, who ask when they will be provided with their own flying bison. Tenzin states that riding a bison takes years of training, much to the students' dismay, and points out that there are not enough bison in the temple to accommodate all of the students. Kai notices a herd of bison flying nearby and suggests using those, prompting Tenzin to explain that a wild herd would require a great deal of training."

Bumi rallies the airbenders for a rescue mission and eases their concerns over not being ready. The group sets off to the valley on two flying bison and prepare for an ambush near the camp. Bumi deduces that the men who took Jinora and Kai are bison rustlers, alarming the recruits, who are reluctant to fight; Bumi reminds them that they must stick together as airbenders. In his cage, Kai manages to pick the lock and escape, but is caught by a poacher as he attempts to free Jinora and the other bison. Before he can be subdued, the airbenders appear and defeat the majority of the bison rustlers except for Ganbat; he attempts to escape on his truck with Jinora and three calves. As Kai pursues the truck, Tenzin, who is searching for Jinora on his own on Oogi, is surprised by three adult bison flying past him quickly; seeing that they are pursuing Ganbat's truck, he investigates more closely and realizes that Jinora is trapped in the cage along with the calves. Tenzin uses Oogi to ram the truck off course, and a wild bison knocks it back with an air swipe, ending the chase. Ganbat surrenders, but Kai angrily continues his own attack, throwing Ganbat around for a few moments before Tenzin stops him; he explains that airbenders do not attack defenseless foes, but compliments Kai on his technique nonetheless.",
