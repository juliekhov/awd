Korra tries explaining that she was attempting to ease the tension between spirits and humans and that having the United Republic's military surrounding the portal would only anger the spirits more, prompting Iroh to explain that that was not what he intended. Tenzin tries convincing him to get the military to leave. He offers the Air Nation's help protecting the portal instead. He is supported by Ikki, who mentions there was nobody better for the job. Iroh considers the offer, but ultimately rejects it as he has his orders. He suggests taking it up with Raiko instead. Annoyed, Korra leaves to talk to Raiko."
