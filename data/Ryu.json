As he tried to retreat into his room, he was grabbed by his collar by Korra and forcefully planted on a chair at the table, where he was lectured about his responsibility as a citizen of the ${link_5} to take an interest in his new abilities. Ryu, however, remained nonplussed and said he did not ask to become one, to which Korra retaliated that she did not ask to be the Avatar, yet still had her duties to fulfill. He kept on insisting she did not have to do so, maintaining an uncaring attitude about the entire situation. He aggravated the Avatar to the point where she grabbed him by his collar and started to forcefully drag him out of the house. As both Korra and his mother tried to get him out of the front door, Ryu catapulted himself back into the house by blasting the wall with airbending. As Mako and Bolin guided a frustrated Korra back to their ${link_6}, he was slapped by his mother for having landed on her and his overall behavior.",

He met Korra's greeting with a stoic attitude, uninterested in learning the ways of the airbenders. As he tried to retreat into his room, he was grabbed by his collar by Korra and forcefully planted on a chair at the table, where he was lectured about his responsibility as a citizen of the world to take an interest in his new abilities. Ryu, however, remained nonplussed and said he did not ask to become one, to which Korra retaliated that she did not ask to be the Avatar, yet still had her duties to fulfill. He kept on insisting she did not have to do so, maintaining an uncaring attitude about the entire situation. He aggravated the Avatar to the point where she grabbed him by his collar and started to forcefully drag him out of the house. As both Korra and his mother tried to get him out of the front door, Ryu catapulted himself back into the house by blasting the wall with airbending. As Mako and Bolin guided a frustrated Korra back to their Future Industries airship, he was slapped by his mother for having landed on her and his overall behavior."
