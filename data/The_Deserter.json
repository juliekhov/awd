However, Sokka points out they are wanted criminals. To ensure they are not discovered, they disguise themselves and acquire festival masks soon after their arrival. At first, the three enjoy the festivities, although they bear witness to a puppet show where Fire Lord Ozai is presented as a great hero, facing off against \"evil\" Earth Kingdom soldiers. They stumble upon a firebending show, which has the audience dazzled. When asking for volunteers for his next trick, the performer, Malu, calls Katara up to the stage he has her play the part of a damsel in distress and ties her to a chair. Malu proceeds by creating a dragon of fire; making a show of it, however, he seems to lose control of it, and it flies directly toward Katara. Aang, fearing for Katara's safety, leaps onto the stage to shield Katara, and uses airbending to stop the fire dragon. It is revealed to the crowd that Aang is the Avatar, causing Fire Nation soldiers to give chase to him, and the three friends escape from them."
