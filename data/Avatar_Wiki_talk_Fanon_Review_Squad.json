I would like to firstly note that this is not simply because I have had a busy few weeks, but because I have seen my lifestyle change and evolve over the course of my seventeenth year. I have realized that as my time allotted for reading, analyzing, and critiquing the fanfics of the Fanon Portal has decreased, the quality of my reviews has diminished as well. It is a simple relationship that I am sure my fellow reviewers have noticed in their work as well; generally, it is an issue that can be addressed over time, however problems arise when a situation morphs in such a way that there is no simple solution.",

I find myself exhausted at 12:30 in the morning and barely able to keep myself awake to post a wordy and rather poorly written resignation. I find that my decision has come down to the choice as to whether I want to sleep and get good grades, get good grades and be a member of the Fanon Review Squad, or be a member of the FRS and sleep.
