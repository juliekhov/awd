After the Air Nation witnessed the destructive power of the spirit energy cannon, many of them retreated to the factory and Korra later brought Baatar Jr. there as well after she and a stealth team of airbenders had kidnapped him from his airship. The factory was later blown up by Kuvira, who had learned that Korra was there and had traced Baatar Jr.'s radio call back to the facility."
