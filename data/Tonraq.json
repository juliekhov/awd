Sometime after this, Zaheer, P'Li, Ghazan, and Ming-Hua attempted to kidnap Korra, but Tonraq, along with Tenzin, Chief Sokka, and Fire Lord Zuko, stopped the criminals and placed them in special prisons designed to neutralize their bending. In response to the group's attempt, Tonraq and Tenzin decided to keep Korra isolated in a compound in the Southern Water Tribe for her own safety, so she could focus completely on mastering the bending arts."

Over the next three weeks, Tonraq grew worried about his daughter's well-being, noticing her lack of sleep and appetite, and although he decided not to push her, he was pleased that she eventually went to seek Katara's help."
