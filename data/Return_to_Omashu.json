She accepts his offer with a smirk. Soon after, Ty Lee performs a feat of balance on the high wire. Azula asks the ringmaster if he believes she will fall; he confidently replies, \"Of course not.\" Azula then asks the ringmaster to have the net, which is positioned below Ty Lee, removed, decides it would be more interesting if she did it without the safety net; when the ringmaster tries to object, Azula relents for a moment before deciding to have the net set on fire. Unwilling to refuse a direct order from a member of the Fire Nation Royal family, he concedes and sets it ablaze. As the fire grows, Ty Lee becomes more and more anxious; the ringmaster is also clearly worried for Ty Lee's safety. Azula subsequently orders the ringmaster to release all of his dangerous animals inside the tent; again, the ringmaster fearfully complies."
