Eska comforted him and recalled the time she attempted to murder Korra for ruining her wedding with Bolin. P'Li greeted the group once they arrived at her cell, asserting that she had not seen any visitors since the beginning of her imprisonment and immediately concluded that the group's arrival was an indication that Zaheer had escaped."
