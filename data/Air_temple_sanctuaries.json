Jinora was in awe upon seeing the statues of the past Avatars, and more so upon seeing that of her grandfather. Ikki and Meelo were not paying attention and decided to\u00a0race around the room on air scooters. The race was cut short when Meelo crashed to a statue, knocking it over and obliterating it.\u00a0Shortly after this, Jinora, while looking at Aang's statue, felt a presence. However, she turned around to only find more statues. In the middle of the night, she returned to the statue room and made her way up the chamber. She took notice of an odd statue, carved from wood rather than stone. Intrigued by it, Jinora stared at the statue, unaware of the Avatar it was meant to depict. While admiring it, the statue began to glow concurrently with Korra opening the spirit portal at the South Pole."
