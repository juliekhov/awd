Aang initially objects, but, finding no other reasonable course to take, he and the others agree. Sokka, however, sadly states that he will stay in the palace, as the Earth King will need guidance in the days to come. Katara quickly cuts him off, knowing that her brother's desire to meet their father is greater than her own and states that she will stay with the Earth King instead. Thus their actions are decided \u2013 Aang will take Sokka to where Hakoda is stationed before proceeding to the Eastern Air Temple on Appa, Toph will go to meet her mother, and finally, Katara will stay behind to assist the Earth King."
