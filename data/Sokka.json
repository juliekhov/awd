Sokka also discovered that his girlfriend, Suki was being held at the prison. He initially decides to escape the prison with Suki, Zuko and other inmates but decides to wait for his father to possibly arrive. Sokka's father, Hakoda did in fact arrive and Sokka formulated a plan of escape with him. The two along with Zuko, Suki and another inmate execute the plan and after a fight with Azula they managed to escape the prison. However Sokka was again separated from his father at the Western Air Temple due to a Fire Nation ambush, with Sokka going with Aang, Katara, Toph, Zuko and Suki. During the final battle of the Hundred Year War, Sokka, along with Toph and Suki, were in charge of destroying the Fire Nation airship fleet, a task which they achieved. Afterward, Sokka, along with Toph and Suki, joined together to berate the now fallen Ozai and commented on how impressive Aang looked while fighting. After Ozai was defeated, all the war prisoners were released, and Sokka and Katara were once again reunited with their father."

      "text": "When Aang eventually managed to strike up a conversation with Satoru about the refinery's location and accused the factory of having defiled the sacred land, Sokka backed him up, stating that nature could never have polluted a river to the point the river near the factory had been defiled. However, when Toph corroborated Satoru's claim that the factory was not to blame for that, Sokka instantly changed his opinion, backing the earthbender up instead. When Toph subsequently got into an argument with Aang, the ground shook and Sokka urged the two earthbenders to remain calm, assuming they were responsible for it. When a second, bigger quake occurred, Satoru asked them all to leave, but before they could heed the engineer's request, they heard a factory worker call for help, the earthquakes having left him trapped under a haywire machine. Sokka instantly helped usher the factory workers to safety under cover from Katara, who used her waterbending to pulverize incoming rocks, while Aang and Toph moved in to save the trapped man. After the crisis was averted, Sokka was shocked to learn that Loban's business partner and co-owner of the refinery was Lao Beifong, Toph's father and accused him of being a liar when he declared Toph to be a confused girl, rather than his daughter."

When Master Piandao attacked Sokka, Aang, Katara, and Toph rushed in to help him, but he told his friends to stay back as it was his battle to fight alone. He had to prove himself as a swordsman, although it turned out Piandao simply attacked his pupil just to test him. Later, he held a similar view during Aang's battle with Ozai when Sozin's Comet arrived. When Suki suggested she, Toph, and Sokka should help Aang, Sokka pointed out that \"the Fire Lord is Aang's fight\". He understood it was Aang's destiny to face Ozai alone, while he, Suki, and Toph focused their energies on stopping the Fire Nation airship fleet."

However, his hubris got the best of him, and he was viciously thrown out for accidentally adding an extra syllable to the end of a haiku, where he subsequently renounced his short-lived love for poetry. Sokka was also, albeit humorously, a terrible artist, yet somehow strangely unaware or in denial of it. He emotionally defended his \"artwork\", which was still met with more laughter from his peers."
