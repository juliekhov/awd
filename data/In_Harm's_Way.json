Jinora expresses her concern over Kai's safety, believing that he has also been taken, but Korra assures her that they will find him. Mako speculates that the airbenders could be underneath Lake Laogai, as he read in one of Jinora's books that it was used as a secret Dai Li fortress in the past. Jinora states that she can explore it by creating an spiritual projection of herself, much to everyone's surprise. Although she reveals that the projection would not be as strong as it was during Harmonic Convergence, she ensures that the use of the technique will be successful if she is able to create the projection close enough to the lake."
