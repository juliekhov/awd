While fighting the fires and soldiers, Katara came across Jet who claimed that he was on her side and helped her fight the problem. Katara, with the help of Jet, eventually defeated the soldiers and they fled. She returned to the village and found Aang and Sokka there. They split up again to look for Appa with Katara and Sokka traveling to the eastern part of the swamp. Numerous red insects appeared and surrounded them; Katara ran away, leaving Sokka to face them by himself. They returned to the village empty-handed and saw that Aang's search had come up unsuccessful as well. Suddenly, they overheard two villagers talking about a massive creature they wanted to eat for dinner and found Appa only to be attacked by a giant monster composed of plants. They defeated the monster who revealed himself to be merely a waterbender. He educated them about the spirituality of the swamp and Aang had a vision of a massive drill headed for Ba Sing Se. Katara and the others left to find out more about the drill in Aang's vision."
