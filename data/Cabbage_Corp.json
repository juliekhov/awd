      "text": "Following the Equalists' attack on the Pro-bending Arena, the Metalbending Police Force was informed that Cabbage Corp was manufacturing Equalist weaponry. Soon after receiving the information, the police force searched one of Cabbage Corp's warehouses and discovered crates filled with Equalist propaganda and electrified gloves. Lin Beifong soon arrested Lau Gan-Lan outside the company's headquarters and ordered the shutdown of Cabbage Corp in front of a crowd of reporters and journalists. However, it was later discovered that Hiroshi Sato framed the company in an attempt to conceal from the authorities the fact that he had been the one manufacturing the Equalists' weaponry. After Hiroshi was incarcerated, Cabbage Corp resumed its operations, providing low-cost and less sturdy airships to the Earth Kingdom when compared to those produced by Future Industries."
