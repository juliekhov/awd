With the energy capsule in place, Zhu Li initializes phase one but soon reports on a problem with the condenser. She attempts to power the machine down but fails to override the system. Baatar Jr. orders everyone to evacuate, as the cannon is about to explode. Despite Zhu Li's warnings that they too should leave, he reaches into the machine and pulls out a part of its circuitry, effectively powering it down. Baatar Jr. notices that the channeling ring is cracked and alerts the rest of the team that the broken part caused the cannon to overload. Furious about the near-failure of their weapon, he yells that they will spend the remainder of their time taking apart the massive cannon to check everything."

They hug, reconciling their differences, but Bolin unintentionally ruins the moment by joining Lin and Toph's group hug, remarking how great it is to have family. An irritated Toph scoffs and extricates herself from his embrace, and Lin shoves him away from herself. Toph wishes the trio good luck, insulting Bolin by calling him a \"gumflapper\", while Opal asks Toph if she is coming back to Republic City with them. Toph laughs and assures them that her fighting days are over, and that, \"at some point, you gotta leave it to the kids\". Zhu Li thanks the group for rescuing her as well, and asks Opal not to hold Bolin's working for Kuvira against him, saying that his heart was in the right place. Opal smirks and playfully says that Bolin worked his way \"out of the polar bear doghouse\". She gives him a kiss on the cheek as a sign of forgiveness, and Bolin excitedly pumps his fists up and down in triumph."
