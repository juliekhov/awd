Baatar Jr. orders everyone to evacuate, as the cannon is about to explode. Despite Zhu Li's warnings that they too should leave, he reaches into the machine and pulls out a part of its circuitry, effectively powering it down. Baatar Jr. notices that the channeling ring is cracked and alerts the rest of the team that the broken part caused the cannon to overload. Furious about the near-failure of their weapon, he yells that they will spend the remainder of their time taking apart the massive cannon to check everything."

He shouts in desperation to stop the test, but the cannon fires anyway; a massive earthbending wall from Suyin shifts the cannon's balance, causing its aim to shift and miss the town. The beam instead impacts the mountain behind the town, completely boring through it and leaving a gaping, circular hole; Bolin and Opal, witnessing the beam's power up close, are horrified by the sight. Lin and Suyin, working together, attack Kuvira's army in an attempt to take down both Kuvira and the cannon. Wei and Wing also lend their aid to the assault effort. Suyin, making her way toward Kuvira, leaps atop the cannon and engages Kuvira in single combat, both of them using metalbending; their attacks begin with simple manipulation of the metal strips on their armor, quickly escalate to Suyin hurling a locomotive freight car at Kuvira and Kuvira attacking Suyin with a sword made of the metal strips. Kuvira soon overpowers Suyin and throws her from the cannon deck; metalbender soldiers begin to surround Suyin, but Wing intervenes, using earthbending and metalbending to move him and Suyin to where Lin and Wei are. They find themselves surrounded again; the four of them earthbend a protective wall around themselves, but Kuvira's soldiers begin breaking through it.",
