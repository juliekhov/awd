Curtis said that \"I'm kind of like the Darth Vader character for that franchise\", which is interesting because in the original Star Wars trilogy, Darth Vader was shown as the main antagonist like animated Zhao, while the Emperor was hidden like animated Ozai. He also said that \"I haven't watched the TV series to get confused by it.\" Referring to Shyamalan, \"I wanted to take his lead on what way he wanted to take the franchise. He's had to condense, I don't know how many episodes, but two or three years' worth of television episodes into three movies.\""
