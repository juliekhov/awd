Enraged, he retaliated with two powerful fire streams, but they were blocked by a wall of coal created by Tyro. Realizing that he had a prison riot on his hands, he ordered his soldiers to show no mercy in putting the prisoners down. However, the advantage of the firebenders and guards had disappeared now that there was a bendable substance on the prison yard, and the earthbenders, with help from\u00a0Team Avatar, soon managed to gain the upper hand. Three earthbenders created a bed of coal underneath the warden, levitated him off of the metal island and dropped him into the water below, much to the warden's fear as he proclaimed that he could not swim."

He also displayed contempt for earthbending, referring to it as \"brutish savagery that passes for bending\".",
