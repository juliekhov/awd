She leaves the bathroom, allowing the man responsible for the disturbance to enter.

She stumbles to a nearby alley and leans on the wall to steady herself. Breathing heavily while clutching her head, she notices someone standing at the end of the alleyway. Focusing on the individual, she discovers that it resembles herself as she appeared during her battle with ${link_7}; the figure is in the Avatar State and dressed in her old ${link_8} clothes, with a length of broken chain wrapped around the right arm. When Korra calls out to the apparition, it attacks her with the chain. Although she retaliates with a ${link_9} blast, she ends up knocked down with the chain ensnaring her left wrist. Korra yells for the apparition to leave her alone as it stalks closer before engulfing the alley in flame with a large blast of fire. As the fire dissipates, she realizes that she is alone. When several bystanders who witnessed her outburst offer her help, Korra turns them down.",

Opening the faucet, she bends the water to her elbow in order to heal a wound she sustained. Her concentration is broken by insistent knocking and a shout for her to hurry out. She leaves the bathroom, allowing the man responsible for the disturbance to enter. Lost in thought with her eyes trained on the floor, Korra walks on the street and barely avoids being run over by a Satomobile, diving out of the way at the last second. She stumbles to a nearby alley and leans on the wall to steady herself. Breathing heavily while clutching her head, she notices someone standing at the end of the alleyway. Focusing on the individual, she discovers that it resembles herself as she appeared during her battle with Zaheer; the figure is in the Avatar State and dressed in her old Water Tribe clothes, with a length of broken chain wrapped around the right arm. When Korra calls out to the apparition, it attacks her with the chain. Although she retaliates with a firebending blast, she ends up knocked down with the chain ensnaring her left wrist. Korra yells for the apparition to leave her alone as it stalks closer before engulfing the alley in flame with a large blast of fire. As the fire dissipates, she realizes that she is alone. When several bystanders who witnessed her outburst offer her help, Korra turns them down."
