Banking on Kei Lo relaying it to their enemies and Zuko opting to travel via a hidden path, Ukano and the bulk of his forces prepared to ambush the Fire Lord's caravan there, trapping them by knocking down trees with dynamite. Ukano demanded that Zuko relinquish the throne, promising not to harm Ursa and her family if he did. Zuko outright refused and though he and his Kyoshi Warrior bodyguards managed to put up a fight, the Society members eventually subdued them. To punish Zuko for his defiance, Ukano ordered his firebenders to burn the carriage containing Ursa and her family. When Kei Lo openly rebelled and freed Zuko, Ukano boasted to Kei Lo that his soft heart was what had made him so useful to the Society. Upon the arrival of reinforcements in the form of Mai, Ty Lee, Iroh, and the other Kyoshi Warriors, Ukano ordered his men to attack the carriage. Mai recognized his voice, however, and confronted him, accusing him of insanity and treason. As Mai was forced to defend herself against members of the Society, Ukano came to her rescue and ordered his followers to avoid hurting her and attack Kei Lo instead."
