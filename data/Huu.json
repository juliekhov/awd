Aang and ${link_4} immediately came to Sokka's aid, but the two benders had some trouble defeating the \"monster\". Huu entrapped Sokka in the vines and threatened to engulf him completely, but Katara used her ice breath to freeze the water in the vines ensnaring Sokka and used a powerful stream of water to free him completely. Huu's identity was eventually revealed when Katara sent numerous water slices at the monster in rapid succession, too quick for Huu to gather more vines in order to maintain his disguise. With one final slice, Katara severed the wooden board that served as the monster's face, revealing that the monster was Huu all along.",

Huu, in the form of a plant monster, attacked them, not knowing Aang was the Avatar and wanting to protect the swamp from the machete-wielding Sokka. Aang and Katara immediately came to Sokka's aid, but the two benders had some trouble defeating the \"monster\". Huu entrapped Sokka in the vines and threatened to engulf him completely, but Katara used her ice breath to freeze the water in the vines ensnaring Sokka and used a powerful stream of water to free him completely. Huu's identity was eventually revealed when Katara sent numerous water slices at the monster in rapid succession, too quick for Huu to gather more vines in order to maintain his disguise. With one final slice, Katara severed the wooden board that served as the monster's face, revealing that the monster was Huu all along."
