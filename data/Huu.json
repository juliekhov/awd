Once they arrived there, he taught the trio about the connection of all living things in the world, saying that \"[they] all [had] the same roots, and [they were] all branches of the same tree.\" He explained that the swamp \"told\" people that they were still connected to their loved ones that had died, that \"time [was] an illusion, and so [was] death\". Due to Huu's lesson, Aang was able to use the connections in the swamp to track down Appa and Momo from whom they got separated after the storm."
