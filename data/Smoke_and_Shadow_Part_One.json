He is excited to show his mother how much has changed. Ursa caresses his face, commenting on the sparkle in his eyes he has had since he was little. Zuko points out that he is now the Fire Lord, prompting an apology from his mother. Zuko leaves Ursa and Noren to investigate what his friends are doing. Noren asks Ursa if she is fine, causing her to question why. He tells her that her hands are cold, just like they used to be on opening nights on the theater when they were young. Ursa explains it has been a long time since she has been to the palace and that she will be okay. She notices Kiyi with Aang on the flying dolphin fishes and pleads for her to come back to the ship. Aang hurriedly airbends himself and Kiyi back to the ship, promising she was not in any danger. Ursa hugs her daughter, telling her she can not lose her. Distressed, Kiyi screams to be let go and asks her father to\u00a0take her\u00a0downstairs. Noren abides. Zuko comforts Ursa, who figures not every girl has to deal with her mother changing faces. Aang apologizes for worrying Ursa and explains that dolphin fishes are among the gentlest creatures in the world. Ursa apologizes for her overreaction and excuses herself.",

Sokka notes on their enjoyment, but refuses joining them when Katara suggests it, claiming a preference for mechanical rides, with the exception of Appa, who promptly licks him. Zuko emerges from inside the cruiser with Ursa and Noren, telling everyone they are one day away from the main island. He is excited to show his mother how much has changed. Ursa caresses his face, commenting on the sparkle in his eyes he has had since he was little. Zuko points out that he is now the Fire Lord, prompting an apology from his mother. Zuko leaves Ursa and Noren to investigate what his friends are doing. Noren asks Ursa if she is fine, causing her to question why. He tells her that her hands are cold, just like they used to be on opening nights on the theater when they were young. Ursa explains it has been a long time since she has been to the palace and that she will be okay. She notices Kiyi with Aang on the flying dolphin fishes and pleads for her to come back to the ship. Aang hurriedly airbends himself and Kiyi back to the ship, promising she was not in any danger. Ursa hugs her daughter, telling her she can not lose her. Distressed, Kiyi screams to be let go and asks her father to\u00a0take her\u00a0downstairs. Noren abides. Zuko comforts Ursa, who figures not every girl has to deal with her mother changing faces. Aang apologizes for worrying Ursa and explains that dolphin fishes are among the gentlest creatures in the world. Ursa apologizes for her overreaction and excuses herself."

Ty Lee notices members of the New Ozai Society on a higher ledge, both she and Mai leap from the watchtower, Ty Lee convinced of Kei Lo's good aura, Mai simply stating she does not believe in auras. The guard leading the group urges to be ready, but not so as much to give away they already know about the enemy's planned attack. While he does so, he is attacked from behind. The New Ozai Society attacks, but Mai, Ty Lee, and the Kyoshi Warriors make short work of them. Iroh exits the caravan, ready for battle, only to discover their enemies were already dealt with. He congratulates them on their quick work, and Mai argues that it was too quick, suspicious of the low number of attackers sent, when she knows her father has amassed an army. She tries to question one of the attacks, to no avail. Ty Lee notices Suki's distress flare, and Mai sarcastically mentions Kei Lo's good aura."
