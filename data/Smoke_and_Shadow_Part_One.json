He is excited to show his mother how much has changed. Ursa caresses his face, commenting on the sparkle in his eyes he has had since he was little. Zuko points out that he is now the Fire Lord, prompting an apology from his mother. Zuko leaves Ursa and Noren to investigate what his friends are doing. Noren asks Ursa if she is fine, causing her to question why. He tells her that her hands are cold, just like they used to be on opening nights on the theater when they were young. Ursa explains it has been a long time since she has been to the palace and that she will be okay. She notices Kiyi with Aang on the flying dolphin fishes and pleads for her to come back to the ship. Aang hurriedly airbends himself and Kiyi back to the ship, promising she was not in any danger. Ursa hugs her daughter, telling her she can not lose her. Distressed, Kiyi screams to be let go and asks her father to\u00a0take her\u00a0downstairs. Noren abides. Zuko comforts Ursa, who figures not every girl has to deal with her mother changing faces. Aang apologizes for worrying Ursa and explains that dolphin fishes are among the gentlest creatures in the world. Ursa apologizes for her overreaction and excuses herself.",

Sokka notes on their enjoyment, but refuses joining them when Katara suggests it, claiming a preference for mechanical rides, with the exception of Appa, who promptly licks him. Zuko emerges from inside the cruiser with Ursa and Noren, telling everyone they are one day away from the main island. He is excited to show his mother how much has changed. Ursa caresses his face, commenting on the sparkle in his eyes he has had since he was little. Zuko points out that he is now the Fire Lord, prompting an apology from his mother. Zuko leaves Ursa and Noren to investigate what his friends are doing. Noren asks Ursa if she is fine, causing her to question why. He tells her that her hands are cold, just like they used to be on opening nights on the theater when they were young. Ursa explains it has been a long time since she has been to the palace and that she will be okay. She notices Kiyi with Aang on the flying dolphin fishes and pleads for her to come back to the ship. Aang hurriedly airbends himself and Kiyi back to the ship, promising she was not in any danger. Ursa hugs her daughter, telling her she can not lose her. Distressed, Kiyi screams to be let go and asks her father to\u00a0take her\u00a0downstairs. Noren abides. Zuko comforts Ursa, who figures not every girl has to deal with her mother changing faces. Aang apologizes for worrying Ursa and explains that dolphin fishes are among the gentlest creatures in the world. Ursa apologizes for her overreaction and excuses herself."

Ursa hesitates for a moment before walking into the palace, saying she is just tired when Zuko questions her. He says he will have someone show her to her old room, and she says one of the guest rooms will suffice, walking further into the palace. Iroh arrives, and Zuko thanks him for his help and asks him if Ursa will be fine. Iroh is glad to have helped and is certain that time will heal her wounds. He also detects something else is bothering Zuko. Zuko explains that the New Ozai Society is different from the opposition he has had since becoming Fire Lord, more serious, and asks Iroh to represent him in Yu Dao's inauguration ceremony, allowing him to stay to deal with the matter. Iroh agrees, saying he was just about to suggest the same, and commends Zuko on his growing wisdom, agreeing when he asks if it is because he is beginning to think more like Iroh himself. Ursa walks through the palace, thinking to herself that Ozai is no longer there, that Zuko is in charge, and that she and her family are safe. Still, she is distressed when she looks up to see Ozai's portrait in the Royal Gallery. Elsewhere, Ukano also looks at Ozai's official portrait and is once again visited by the Kemurikage, who declare him to have failed in redeeming himself and that he must suffer. Ukano begs for one more month to have Zuko removed from the throne. The Kemurikage grant him the extension, warning him as they vanish that if he fails, he will lose all that is dear to him."

Kei Lo does not believe her, instead thinking it took her this long to truly trust him. She agrees that could be a reason, but only because she cannot figure out why he would betray the New Ozai Society. Kei Lo insists it was because of her, and Mai finds that not to make sense. Kei Lo explains he lost his parents at a young age and has since bounced between places. He joined the society to belong to something, not caring about their political agenda. Mai asks what has changed, and he says that meeting her made him realize he wants to belong to someone, not something. Suddenly, they hear Michi screaming, and Kei Lo spots the Kemurikage on top of the roof of Mura's flower shop. Mai attacks the Kemurikage, and the two give pursuit, jumping onto the roof. Mai asks them what they want, and they turn around saying they have what they want, showing Tom-Tom on their arms. Mai rushes forward, but the Kemurikage vanish, taking Tom-Tom with them. The following night, Michi and Mura plead for an officer to get Tom-Tom back. The officer asks Mai for a description of the attacker, who Mai identifies as the Kemurikage, spirits from legend that inhabited the mountains of the capital, who would snatch misbehaving children in the middle of the night. Michi tells her that the Kemurikage are just a story that parents tell their children, that she herself heard the story from her parents, certain that they cannot be real. Zuko arrives, concluding that they must be real. Mai inquires about the reason for his presence, prompting him to explain that he heard what happened to Tom-Tom and that he wants to help. Michi is grateful for the Fire Lord's concern. However, Zuko concludes that if they truly are going to be battling spirits, they will need the help of the Avatar.",
