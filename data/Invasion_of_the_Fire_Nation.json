It was there where Sokka discovered a piece of scorched parchment labeled \"The Darkest Day in Fire Nation History\". Curious, Sokka wanted to know what happened on the Darkest Day. Fortunately for him, he was led to a celestial calendar by one of Wan Shi Tong's animal servants. This calendar had the ability to place accurate models of the sun and the moon's position in relation to the Earth. By entering the date found on the parchment, Sokka was able to find that on the Darkest Day, a solar eclipse had occurred, causing firebenders to lose their bending ability, leaving them helpless. Sokka and Aang also found that the date of the next eclipse was only months away, and before Sozin's Comet was due to arrive."

      "text": "Upon arriving at the Capital, the invaders blasted through the harbor gates and dodged shots launched from shoreline ballistae that were intended to drag in the submarines for capture. The invaders stormed the coastline and charged at the Fire Nation forces, with the earthbenders piloting five earthbending-powered tanks and several supply trucks as support. Several Foggy Swamp Tribesmen, among them Due, Huu, and Tho, were assigned to defend the submarines in case the group was forced to retreat. The Water Tribe and Earth Kingdom warriors, led by Chief Hakoda and Bato, focused on destroying the many Fire Nation battlements defending the Royal Plaza while the tanks focused on the tundra tanks swarming onto their position. These tanks were not much of a match against the advanced earthbending-powered tanks, which literally crushed these vehicles. The supply trucks carried rocks and water for the warriors to use in their fight against the Fire Nation."
