The campaign stirred up all sorts of debate online. What's the difference between a costume that references a culture and one that's culturally offensive? And who gets to decide where to draw that line? Shouldn't cosplay just be about fantasy and fun? Why bring real-world politics into it? I was thinking about all this as I was writing this particular subplot.",
