As Bolin told her he would think of her whenever he ate kale, she called him sweet. When he expressed his displeasure about her departure, she assured him that they would be together soon, verifying in a hopeful tone that Team Avatar planned to go to the Northern Air Temple after finding more airbenders. Making light of the situation, she offered Bolin a bite of her kale wrap, stating that until they would meet again, they would always have kale. She was subsequently praised in a toast by her mother for being an incredible daughter, sister, friend, and soon to be airbending master. After dinner, Opal departed on an airship, waving goodbye to her family and friends."
