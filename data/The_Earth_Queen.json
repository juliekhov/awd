The two brothers walk by a fruit stand, and Bolin attempts to coerce Mako to help him with the \"fruit stand scam\" they used to execute in the past. The firebender refuses to take part and expresses his disgust at the state of the fruit on display, prompting a wary Tu to appear from behind the stand. He interrogates the brothers and attempts to intimidate them, eventually tackling the two to the ground after concluding that they are planning to steal his fruit. Tu's father, Chow, appears shortly after and recognizes Mako and Bolin as his brother's children, much to their surprise."
