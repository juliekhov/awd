During the task force's preparation, he became acquainted with Sokka and developed a strong disregard for him. Sokka immediately recognized Hahn's shallowness and his lack of love for Yue and, therefore, did not act respectfully toward him. Hahn mocked Sokka for being a mere Southern Water Tribesman and for his concern over his engagement to the tribal princess. The two physically fought each other when Sokka's hatred for Hahn boiled over, resulting in Sokka being relieved from his duties; however, Hahn showed no remorse whatsoever for the altercation."
