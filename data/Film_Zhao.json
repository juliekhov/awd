Zhao was heading back to the prayer room when he discovered downed soldiers. The soldier who accompanied him quickly ran back to alert the others that the Avatar had escaped and to close the inner gates. Aang entered the temple courtyard with the blue-masked figure, referred by the soldiers as the Blue Spirit, where they engaged many Fire Nation soldiers in combat. When Zhao ordered his soldiers not to kill the Avatar, the Blue Spirit quickly grabbed Aang and threateningly held his sword to the boy's throat. Zhao, with no choice but to let them go, ordered his soldiers to stand down and remain in the courtyard while the Blue Spirit led Aang across the bridge. At the end of the bridge, Zhao ordered an archer to fire and the soldier shot down the Blue Spirit with single arrow. The soldiers quickly rushed across the bridge to capture them but Aang used his airbending to pull in the fog and mask their getaway."
