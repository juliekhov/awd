Just as the soldiers were about to attack, Longshot stunned the leader from his position, and a fight soon ensued. Amidst the battle, he remained perched on a tree branch, firing arrows aimed at the soldiers' weapons. He disarmed at least six soldiers during the assault. After the battle, he returned to the ${link_9} with the rest of the raiding party, as well as Aang, Sokka and Katara. He was later assigned to fire an arrow that would initiate the flooding of ${link_10}, though this mission was a failure as Sokka was able to warn the town's residents in time for them to evacuate safely.",

The Freedom Fighters hid among the large trees above the camp site, waiting for an adequate distraction that would allow them to attack. The diversion was provided by Sokka, Katara, and Aang who stumbled upon the campgrounds, alerting the soldiers who were lounging by a campfire. Just as the soldiers were about to attack, Longshot stunned the leader from his position, and a fight soon ensued. Amidst the battle, he remained perched on a tree branch, firing arrows aimed at the soldiers' weapons. He disarmed at least six soldiers during the assault. After the battle, he returned to the treetop hideout with the rest of the raiding party, as well as Aang, Sokka and Katara. He was later assigned to fire an arrow that would initiate the flooding of Gaipan, though this mission was a failure as Sokka was able to warn the town's residents in time for them to evacuate safely."
