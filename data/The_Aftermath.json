      "text": "All of the benders in the factory are easily defeated by Hiroshi's mecha tanks, and Hiroshi orders the chi blockers to round up their captives to be brought to Amon. As Mako and Bolin enter and try to save an unconscious Korra, Tenzin, and Lin, they are spotted by Hiroshi and the Lieutenant. Mako realizes that Hiroshi sponsoring the Fire Ferrets and supporting the Avatar was merely a ploy to gain their trust. Using an electrified glove, the businessman confirms it and states that it broke his heart watching Asami fall for a \"firebending street rat\" like Mako. At that moment, he notices that Asami has entered as well and heard his statement. Seeing her disbelief and shock, Hiroshi asks her for forgiveness and tells her that he is doing this because of the loss of her mother, who was killed by a firebender. He offers his daughter a glove and tells her to join him and Amon in making a world a better place, free of benders. As Asami takes up the glove, the Fire Ferrets look up in disbelief and despair. However, to everyone's surprise, Asami stuns her father and the Lieutenant and helps her friends escape before the Equalists can stop them."
