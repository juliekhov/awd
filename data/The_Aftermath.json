As Mako and Bolin enter and try to save an unconscious Korra, Tenzin, and Lin, they are spotted by Hiroshi and the Lieutenant. Mako realizes that Hiroshi sponsoring the Fire Ferrets and supporting the Avatar was merely a ploy to gain their trust. Using an electrified glove, the businessman confirms it and states that it broke his heart watching Asami fall for a \"firebending street rat\" like Mako. At that moment, he notices that Asami has entered as well and heard his statement. Seeing her disbelief and shock, Hiroshi asks her for forgiveness and tells her that he is doing this because of the loss of her mother, who was killed by a firebender. He offers his daughter a glove and tells her to join him and Amon in making a world a better place, free of benders. As Asami takes up the glove, the Fire Ferrets look up in disbelief and despair. However, to everyone's surprise, Asami stuns her father and the Lieutenant and helps her friends escape before the Equalists can stop them."

When Tenzin tells her not to give up, she replies that she has not given up, but that she is going to look for her men and face Amon \"outside the law\". Meanwhile, Mako apologizes to Korra for not believing her earlier, justifying himself by noting that Hiroshi being an Equalist just seemed so surreal. When Korra in turns extends a general apology for the entire situation going down like it had, Mako asks if her offer to live at the air temple still stood. The Avatar instantly notes that it does and extends it to Asami as well. As Mako thanks her, Korra guides his attention to his girlfriend, stating that she will need him after everything she went through.
