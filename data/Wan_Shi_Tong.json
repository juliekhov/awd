Tired of witnessing his knowledge be misused to hurt others, Wan Shi Tong began to sink the library, pulling it back into the Spirit World and proceeded to attack the foursome as they had already acquired too much information, in his opinion. As the team split up, the spirit continued to chase down Katara and Momo, intending to add the winged lemur to his specimen collection. However, before he could attack, he was knocked out by Sokka with a blow to the head."
