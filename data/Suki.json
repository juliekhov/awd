The Kyoshi Warriors and Azula's team fought a short duel, during which the warriors were overpowered despite holding the advantage in numbers, and soon only Suki remained standing. She was forced to drive Appa away with a burning branch to keep him safe before clashing with Azula. She was eventually defeated, captured and sent to the Fire Nation as a prisoner, along with the rest of the Kyoshi Warriors. After the guards discovered Suki's identity as the leader she was sent to the Fire Nation's highest security prison, the Boiling Rock.
