When trying to remember the night his home was attacked proves too painful, Katara uses her healing to try to help him out. Jet remembers that he was taken to a secret facility beneath the water of a lake. Sokka remembers what Joo Dee had said about her \"vacation\", where she said she went on vacation to Lake Laogai jogging more of Jet's memory. The base is under Lake Laogai."
