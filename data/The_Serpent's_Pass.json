After accidentally soaking the maps with a ${link_7} bomb, which is similar to a cannonball in a pool, Katara uses her waterbending to extract the water from the maps.

After accidentally soaking the maps with a waterbending bomb, which is similar to a cannonball in a pool, Katara uses her waterbending to extract the water from the maps. The group subsequently huddles around the map to discuss in which direction they should go, concluding that the Serpent's Pass appears to be the most direct route. Just as they decide to take the mountainous route, a group of three Earth Kingdom refugees \u2013 namely Than, his pregnant wife, Ying, and his sister \u2013 approaches and greets the gang. Hearing the group's plans to go through the Serpent's Pass, which Ying describes as a \"deadly\" route for only the desperate, the Earth Kingdom trio convinces Aang's group to go to Full Moon Bay instead to take a ferry to Ba Sing Se."
