Asami drives the car closer to the truck so the driver is visible and Mako shoots his lightning at the driver. The driver becomes unconscious and the truck begins to swerve before tumbling to its sides, hitting the lamp post before it stopped. Photos are taken by reporters as the team waits for the police to arrive. Korra smiles as Tarrlok approaches them.",
