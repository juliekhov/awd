One of the procedures of this action was the relocation of Fire Nation citizens from the foreign settlements they had created over the past century. This order of removal had negative demographic consequences not considered by any of the parties to the agreement. A year into the operation of the movement, Zuko withdrew his support after being accused of being a traitor by his own people, precipitating a confrontation with his friend, Avatar Aang."

He also agreed with Wu to start evacuating the city, entrusting the royal with coordinating the effort together with the police force. Considering it was a voluntary evacuation, it was initially going slow, with only eighteen families responding to the request. However, when Raiko made the evacuation mandatory due to Kuvira's imminent attack on the city, the citizens flocked to Central City Station and other transportation hubs to leave the metropolis. Although Mako initially created a panic by confusing the people with his evacuation instructions out of the manual, Prince Wu managed to calm everyone down and coordinate the exodus in an organized manner with Pema's help."
