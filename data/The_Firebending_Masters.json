Zuko says that the dragons were the original firebenders, but that they have been extinct for some time. Flabbergated, Aang comments that when he was a kid there were many dragons and Avatar Roku had a dragon, but Zuko does not find it very helpful. Knowing that either he needs to find another way to firebend or the Avatar needs to find a new teacher, Zuko tells Aang about an ancient civilization that died out thousands of years earlier called the Sun Warriors, hoping the ruins of the culture could provide an alternate but equally viable source."
