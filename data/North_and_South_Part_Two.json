He responds to Katara's skepticism by saying that, as a bender, she has no way of knowing the advantages benders hold over nonbenders, and that the use of machines can, at last, bring equality among them. Sokka joins in the conversation, leading to an exchange about the machines used at the Earthen Fire Refinery, which in turns leads to the revelation that Malina and Maliq are business partners with Earthen Fire Industries. Malina tells them that the company is sending a representative to help them and, pointing at a coat-clad, shoe-wearing Toph walking toward them, identifies her as the person in question. After Sokka and Katara greet her excitedly, Toph speaks with Malina and Maliq, telling them that she looks forward to working with them. Malina and Maliq tell Katara and Sokka that they are having a festival in town that evening and insist that they come as guests of honor. Upon learning that there will be food at the festival, Sokka wholeheartedly agrees to go, to the displeasure of Katara."

Hakoda retorts that he knew about the plan all along and allowed them to continue after Malina assured him that they had changed their minds. When Gilak insists adamantly that her words are nothing but a calculated lie, Hakoda cites Zuko as an example of someone whose intentions came to change over time. Now convinced that Hakoda is beyond saving, Gilak brands Hakoda a traitor and attacks him. Hakoda easily deflects the attacks and deals several painful blows of his own to Gilak, staggering him briefly."
