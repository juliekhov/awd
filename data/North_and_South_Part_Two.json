Sokka joins in the conversation, leading to an exchange about the machines used at the Earthen Fire Refinery, which in turns leads to the revelation that Malina and Maliq are business partners with Earthen Fire Industries. Malina tells them that the company is sending a representative to help them and, pointing at a coat-clad, shoe-wearing Toph walking toward them, identifies her as the person in question. After Sokka and Katara greet her excitedly, Toph speaks with Malina and Maliq, telling them that she looks forward to working with them. Malina and Maliq tell Katara and Sokka that they are having a festival in town that evening and insist that they come as guests of honor. Upon learning that there will be food at the festival, Sokka wholeheartedly agrees to go, to the displeasure of Katara."

After asking him where Hakoda is, Aang comes back to her, and together they race for the city gates. At the same time, Malina and Maliq, who seem to have escaped cleanly, stumble through the snow just outside the gates. Out of nowhere, the boy and girl who stole Maliq's briefcase appear; the boy punches Maliq in the face, and he falls to the snow, stunned. While Malina tries to wake him, Gilak catches up to them. Malina desperately tries to convince him that they will have left the South by sunrise, but her assurance does not satisfy his bitterness, and one of his soldiers rushes at her with a drawn sword. When she defends herself by blasting the man in the face with snow, the other soldiers restrain her and Maliq by throwing a net over them, and the boy and girl, students of Thod, chi-block her."

Hakoda demands that Gilak relent, and Gilak, asserting the rightness of his actions, makes mention of the evidence in the briefcase.

Now convinced that Hakoda is beyond saving, Gilak brands Hakoda a traitor and attacks him.
