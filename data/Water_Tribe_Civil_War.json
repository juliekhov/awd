The conflict began as insurgency of separatist Southern Water Tribe rebels, supported by Varrick Global Industries, rose against the central government which was in turn supported by the Northern Water Tribe and a loyalist Southern minority. Even though the support for independence had a long history at the Southern Water Tribe, it was the attempt of Chief Unalaq to forcibly remove the South's autonomy that caused existing tensions to escalate into civil war. The early and mid stages of the conflict were determined by the absolute military superiority of the North's forces, leading to the expulsion of most rebels into the South Pole's hinterland, while the Northern military controlled the South's ports, cities, and spirit portal."

Even though Unalaq still had supporters in the South, most Southerners felt that the North was invading, and held a meeting at the house belonging to Tonraq and his wife, Senna. Tonraq tried to dissuade the members of his tribe from doing anything particularly violent, but Varrick managed to persuade the men otherwise."
