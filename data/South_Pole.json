Despite causing significant damage to the encampment, they were ultimately defeated and captured, save for Bumi. Using a mecha tank, the retired United Forces commander inadvertently destroyed the entire encampment, freeing the others in the process and allowing them to enter the portal prior to Harmonic Convergence."
