She proceeds to taunt Prince Zuko, who is collapsed on the ground. Though Katara finds water to bend, Azula is too quick for her attacks and the waterbender is forced to flee from her immense flames. Eventually, she discovers a grate with water underneath and some chains nearby. Luring Azula above the grate, she bends the water around them just before Azula is able to release her attack at point-blank range, freezing them both in place. As Azula looks on helplessly, Katara unfreezes the water around herself, swims around in the thawed water, and binds the firebender's hands together to the grate with the chains. She melts the remaining water and runs to Zuko to heal him. He weakly thanks Katara, but she responds tearfully that she should be thanking him for protecting her. Azula sees her brother rise, still alive, and her brittle mind finally shatters completely; she firebends from her mouth wildly before rolling around on the ground, screaming and crying uncontrollably. Zuko and Katara silently look upon what has become of the once-mighty Azula with pity."
