Yangchen's apparition disappears, however, leaving Aang to wonder whether his vision was of the past or of the future. Regardless, the image of the being has strengthened his determination to talk to Satoru and he approaches him, explaining to the engineer that the refinery should not have been built on land sacred to the Air Nomads. Before Satoru can react, Toph interjects, telling Aang that the area was abandoned and that Satoru and his uncle had every right to build there and make the area useful again. Aang tries to explain that Yangchen tries to warn him, leaving him to believe something bad will occur in the near future. However, when he fails to pinpoint an alleged imminent threat, Toph brushed off his concerns with open skepticism. Katara backs Aang up, however, reminding everyone of the polluted river. Satoru acknowledges the defiled state of the water, but claims that the refinery was not the cause of that. No one believes him until Toph puts her hand on his chest and asks him to repeat himself, using her seismic sense to detect a possible lie. When Toph claims Satoru is telling the truth, she is pulled to the side by Aang, who wants to have a talk with her."

Pointing to the refinery, she continues by saying that it employed the same ethic as the one they want for Yu Dao: a place where people worked and lived in harmony, regardless of where they came from. She ends her reasoning by asking him if he really wants to sacrifice it for a \"stupid, backwards holiday\". Aang takes the insult personally and yells at her. At that moment, however, the ground rumbles, and both Katara and Sokka run over, pleading for them to calm down as they are scaring the workers. Aang announces that it was not him, heavily implying that Toph was to blame. The earthbender is heavily offended by his implication of not being able to control her bending and grows angry again, which is when an even larger rumble cuts her off and tips over several crates of refined crystals from the refinery. Not convinced that Aang and Toph had nothing to do with the shakes, Satoru asks them to leave. Before they can heed the request, however, cries for help reach them.",
