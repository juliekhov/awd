Iroh was sure that Zhao ordered the attack on Zuko. He informed Zuko that they had arrived at the Water Tribe stronghold but was concerned that Zhao had no sacredness. Zuko was determined to continue, as he would be allowed to live in peace until he has found the Avatar. At the rear of the flagship, Iroh sent off Zuko on a small boat heading out toward the shore of the Northern Water Tribe stronghold."
