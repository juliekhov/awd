Pressed hard, the rebels are forced to take cover. Eventually, Tonraq orders his men to fall back while he goes after his brother alone. Although he quickly disposes of Unalaq's guards, the Northern chief easily manages to knock Tonraq down, declaring he is too strong for him. Tonraq swiftly denounces their brotherhood, feeling betrayed by Unalaq, who got him banished from the Northern Water Tribe. As Tonraq madly charges Unalaq once again, he is caught off guard by a waterblast aimed at him by Desna and Eska, though their father quickly tells them to stand down. As the brothers barrage each other with their bending, Tonraq powers through Unalaq's attack. Launching himself through the air, he manages to grab the chief; as he is about to punch him in the face, however, Unalaq nimbly frees himself from Tonraq's grasp and strikes him in his unprotected stomach with an ice pillar. Now trapped in ice, Tonraq is forced to helplessly watch on as Unalaq seals his victory with a final blow, which knocks out Tonraq. Standing over his brother's unconscious body, Unalaq assures him that Korra will soon suffer the same fate.",

      "text": "Meanwhile, unable to wait any longer for Korra's arrival, Tonraq and the Southern Water Tribe rebels decide to attack in an attempt to drive the Northern army out of their city. Although they succeeded by nightfall force the Northern troops on the defence, the table turn when Desna, Eska, and Unalaq arrive with numerous dark spirits. Pressed hard, the rebels are forced to take cover. Eventually, Tonraq orders his men to fall back while he goes after his brother alone. Although he quickly disposes of Unalaq's guards, the Northern chief easily manages to knock Tonraq down, declaring he is too strong for him. Tonraq swiftly denounces their brotherhood, feeling betrayed by Unalaq, who got him banished from the Northern Water Tribe. As Tonraq madly charges Unalaq once again, he is caught off guard by a waterblast aimed at him by Desna and Eska, though their father quickly tells them to stand down. As the brothers barrage each other with their bending, Tonraq powers through Unalaq's attack. Launching himself through the air, he manages to grab the chief; as he is about to punch him in the face, however, Unalaq nimbly frees himself from Tonraq's grasp and strikes him in his unprotected stomach with an ice pillar. Now trapped in ice, Tonraq is forced to helplessly watch on as Unalaq seals his victory with a final blow, which knocks out Tonraq. Standing over his brother's unconscious body, Unalaq assures him that Korra will soon suffer the same fate."
