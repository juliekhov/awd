Although he often teased Zuko, who impatiently balked at his advice, they cared deeply about each other. He even thought of Zuko as his surrogate child, his own son having died, and worried over him accordingly. Iroh constantly guided Zuko and tried to help him make good choices. In turn, Zuko was deeply thankful for his uncle and was greatly touched when Iroh indirectly praised him. When Zuko was once confronted with the choice of tracking the Avatar or saving a kidnapped Iroh, he chose the latter. Both depended on each other in exile. Iroh was considered a traitor by the Fire Lord, blamed for the failure of the Siege of the Northern Water Tribe after he attacked Admiral Zhao for killing the mortal form of the Moon Spirit."

Sokka still did not trust Zuko after their history, even going so far as hypothesizing that Zuko covered himself in honey to get Appa to lick him, a sign of affection from the bison. Despite his distrust of Zuko, Sokka did trust Aang and conceded to let Zuko join the group when Aang felt it was the best course of action. Later, Sokka showed Zuko to his room. Sokka was a bit uncomfortable, but Zuko smiled at him, implying he had no hostility toward the other. Sokka remarked to Aang that escorting his former enemy was \"really weird\". Later, Sokka was much more comfortable in tormenting Zuko, going so far as to taunt him and make sarcastic remarks, like asking if he could watch him and Aang practice \"jerkbending\" and literally prodding Zuko with his meteor sword, trying to frustrate him enough to get his firebending back. Although he taunted Zuko, it appeared to be in a joking manner instead of a sign of true hostility unlike his sister."
