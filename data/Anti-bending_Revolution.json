Korra freed the airbenders and hid with Mako elsewhere in the arena. Amon managed to locate the two and utilized bloodbending to remove the Avatar's bending abilities. In response, Mako momentarily knocked out Amon with lightning, picked up Korra, and fled down a corridor. The Equalist leader pursued them, subdued Mako, and prepared to remove his bending. Korra, however, managed to successfully stop Amon using airbending. She blasted him out a window and into the bay, where he had no choice but to waterbend to save himself, divulging his true identity to his followers. Amon's scar was fake, as it washed off in the water. He escaped and freed Tarrlok, the two proceeding to flee the city on a speedboat which Tarrlok later blew up, killing them both."
