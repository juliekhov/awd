If you are patient enough, than the chances are that you will see the motion picture and see finally who is right. Really it does not matter, now does it. If you guys really actually cared enough to be looking up about this kid then you would be here to say how excited you are or sharing facts you have found out. By the way, if any of you have an account on imdb, then could you tell us whether are not it is worth it, because I just want to do it to see if they actually have contacting info. I am the same age as Noah and take Christian Karate. I would LOVE to meet him in person, but not a walk-by or a hey, or an auto-graph, but a really down to earth talk. Maybe about his expirences on set and how he feels about the whole thing. It would be like a child reporter thing. I wonder how I could get in. Any ideas?",
