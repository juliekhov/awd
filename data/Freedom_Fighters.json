Later the gang helped the Freedom Fighters to remove the Fire Nation from the group's locale, a little village called Gaipan, which was situated in a small valley. Unbeknownst to Aang and Katara, Jet planned to liberate the village by blowing up a nearby dam and thereby flooding it, killing both the Fire Nation soldiers and the villagers. However, Sokka discovered the plot, and he was able to evacuate the village before Jet succeeded in tricking Katara and Aang into flooding the village. The gang subsequently abandoned the Freedom Fighters for their unjust actions.",

The Freedom Fighters saved them in a swift ambush against the firebenders and welcomed the gang to their treetop hideout. Jet took a liking to Katara, who admired his skills and sympathized with the loss of his parents to the Fire Nation. Sokka, however, was not fond of Jet, fearing that there was more to the warrior than met the eye. Later the gang helped the Freedom Fighters to remove the Fire Nation from the group's locale, a little village called Gaipan, which was situated in a small valley. Unbeknownst to Aang and Katara, Jet planned to liberate the village by blowing up a nearby dam and thereby flooding it, killing both the Fire Nation soldiers and the villagers. However, Sokka discovered the plot, and he was able to evacuate the village before Jet succeeded in tricking Katara and Aang into flooding the village. The gang subsequently abandoned the Freedom Fighters for their unjust actions."
