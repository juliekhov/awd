However, the mayor refused to leave the city, telling Zuko that he was wrong in allowing the ${link_2} and the ${link_3} to bully him into disregarding his people. After Morishita unfavorably compared him to Fire Lord ${link_4}, Zuko attacked him; nonetheless, Morishita continued to speak his mind, saying that Zuko was clearly not his father because Ozai, despite his flaws, was never a coward or a traitor.
