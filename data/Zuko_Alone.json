Behind her Ty Lee runs forward and performs the move with ease, topping it off with several somersaults. Jealous, Azula pushes her over and laughs. A young Mai sits uninterested against a tree, watching them; she turns, sees Zuko walking through the garden, and diverts her gaze again, now blushing and smiling to herself. Azula takes notice of this and whispers to Ty Lee, \"Watch this.\" Ty Lee giggles as Azula runs up to her brother and mother, asking if Zuko would come play with them, stating that it is important for siblings to spend time together. After a small argument between Zuko and Azula, their mother makes him go and play with the girls."

Zuko wastes no time and charges the soldier, sending blasts of fire toward him as he swings the blades. The man makes a feeble attempt at earthbending a wall to block the attack, but to no avail, and is knocked back against a house."
