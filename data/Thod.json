As the two intended to escape and tell Hakoda all about what they had learned, Thod stood in their way and began telling them a story about a snow rat who learned to talk and walk on his hind feet: Found entertaining by humans, he was invited to sit around their campfire and, after a while, forgot that he was a snow rat and asked the humans to be part of their society. The humans had not forgotten and were insulted by the request, driving the snow rat out of their company and back into the cold, leaving it to forever shiver and gnash his teeth, haunted by the memory of the humans' campfire. Before he could explain the meaning of the story, Katara forcefully moved him out of the way with her waterbending, as the soldiers that had been chasing them were gaining on them again."
