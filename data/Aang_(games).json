He asked the audience if anyone would wish participate. Aang volunteered himself and Sokka. Aang and Sokka battled the contestants and eventually defeated the champion of Earth Rumble VI, the Blind Bandit. Aang believed that the Blind Bandit was meant to be his earthbending master. However, before he could talk to her, the Bandit had already left. Aang asked Xin Fu about the Blind Bandit. After discovering where she lived, the pair headed toward the Beifong estate. Along the way, however, they were ambushed by the bounty hunters from earlier and were taken captive. After breaking out and saving a captive professor, the pair sneaked in to the Beifong estate. While Aang and Sokka were talking to the Blind Bandit, whose name turned out to be Toph Beifong, Aang was captured by Xin Fu. Sokka and Toph headed for the Earth Rumble VI stadium to get Aang back. After Sokka and Toph defeated Xin Fu and freed Aang, Toph agreed to teach the Avatar\u00a0earthbending. The team went to the Si Wong Desert, for they had promised the professor from earlier to deliver some important blueprints."
