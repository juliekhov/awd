This enraged the spirits, allowing Vaatu, the spirit of darkness, to grow increasingly stronger as he fed off their negative energy. As Harmonic Convergence drew near, Vaatu's influence grew to the point where he could directly influence both the Spirit World and the mortal world. Starting around 151 AG, many spirits turned dark and began openly assaulting humanity at various locations across the globe. The number and aggressiveness of dark spirits grew dramatically as time passed, especially around the South Pole. Chief Unalaq took note of these various attacks and used this opportunity to intervene in the South."
