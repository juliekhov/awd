Looking over at the broken redirects, about 80% of them are also of fanon files, and since I'm on a cleaning spree, I'll delete them, but could you guys pay a closer look to it in the future? Many thanks. Omnibender - Talk - Contributions 04:33, September 6, 2010 (UTC)",

There are two active admins and one has made one edit to the fanon namespace in several months, that leaves us with one admin being active on the fanon side. I do not think this is enough at all. Many users have pointed out many flaws in the fanon system that I feel must be taken care of, but they cant be enforced as much with only one person running it all.-- Courage the Cowardly User Message Me Friends 05:05, January 16, 2011 (UTC)",
