Although Wan and Raava tried to mediate between the parties, tension rose, and Jaya was set on having his revenge on the spirits who took so many of his friends. After the spirits were corrupted by Vaatu, Jaya was the first to attack, throwing a fire ball at the dark aye-aye spirits, instigating a fight. Jaya was surprised when Wan halted the fight by bending all four elements, though after he passed out due to the strain on his body caused by Raava's presence inside him, Jaya resumed battling with the spirits and was eventually killed."
