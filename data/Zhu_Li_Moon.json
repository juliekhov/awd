As they agreed that they needed to get out of there, Varrick pointed at Zhu Li, who instantly jumped on a nearby desk and vanished via the ceiling hatch. Leaning back, she offered her hands and pulled Varrick up, while Bolin followed them on his own accord."

When the suits were ready and Zhu Li was about to board, Varrick walked up to her and, after swallowing nervously, declared that he needed to \"attach\" something before they took off. As she asked in confusion to what he wanted to attach something, he promptly opened the small box he was holding, revealing the green ring it held inside, and dropped to his knee, asking her if she would \"do the thing for the rest of [their] lives\". Smiling fondly at him, Zhu Li accepted his proposal and, after he slipped the ring on her finger, kissed him. When he took her in his arms and excitedly announced that they would go attack Kuvira's high-tech machine with their \"barely-functional\" prototype suits, she noted that it was exactly how she always imagined their engagement to be. The two subsequently boarded the same mecha suit, with Zhu Li being the pilot and Varrick manning the welding torch."

The moment they touched down, Varrick started welding, though before he could inflict any serious damage, Zhu Li was forced to abort their attempt, lest they would be crushed. She continuously tried to land again, though Kuvira kept lashing out at them, preventing them from attempting another attack. Eventually, Zhu Li and Varrick's suit had a wing blown off when Kuvira fired her spirit energy cannon. Before they crashed against a building, Zhu Li flipped the ejection seat switches and she and Varrick floated off to safety with their parachutes.",

She was also able to carry a spirit vine capsule with ease, while Varrick struggled to carry it. While working on weaponizing the spirit vines, Zhu Li displayed proficiency in deception and sabotage, having concealed her true motives from both Kuvira and Baatar Jr. Her intelligence and quick thinking allow her to make quick decisions in many situations, and when she commits to a project, she displays great leadership skills.",
