Before he leaves, Aang tells Sho to stay hidden and remember the breathing exercises he showed her while he is gone. Just as the Avatar leaves his hiding place, Combustion Man reveals himself and lunges at Aang. He escapes by jumping on his assailant's head and gliding on the air out of a hole in the train, causing Sho to gasp in surprise and begin to cry. Realizing that she has become distressed at the sight, Aang hovers by the window near Sho on an air scooter and tells her to take deep breaths, before goading Combustion Man into following him onto the roof of the train."
