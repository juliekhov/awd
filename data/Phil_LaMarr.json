      "body": "LaMarr is a graduate of Harvard High School in North Hollywood and Yale University, where he helped found the improv comedy group Purple Crayon. One of his biggest roles at Yale was the titular character in the British comedy Trevor. After graduating in 1989, LaMarr became a member of the award-winning sketch and improv comedy group The Groundlings. He also studied improv at The Second City and at the ImprovOlympic in Chicago with Del Close. He has also improvised with Cold Tofu and Off the Wall. His early film jobs arose from connections from his improv and college years; for example, LaMarr appeared in the film It's Pat because it was written by friends from The Groundlings, and appeared in Bio-Dome because the director was a friend from college. He is well remembered for his small but memorable role in Pulp Fiction as Marvin, and he was a member of the cast of the sketch comedy show MAD TV for five years.",
