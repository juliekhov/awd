Out of nowhere, the vines attack her as well, and, although she is able to avoid them for a few moments, they eventually take her. She uses her last few moments of consciousness to create a spiritual projection of herself, which appears abruptly in front of a shocked Korra and Mako and urges them to help her."

The vines, as with the others, attack them, but Korra and Mako manage to dodge them with ${link_0} and escape into a building, where they find a collection of green, glowing cocoons with people within them.

Korra again insists that she confront Zaheer; this time, Tenzin relents, informing her that Zaheer's prison is located deep in the mountains outside the city.

Mako wants to come in with Korra, but she tells him this is something she needs to do alone.

Utterly terrified, Korra stumbles away from Zaheer, who is mildly amused by her persistent fear; Korra, unnerved by her fear, turns to leave, but she stops when he informs her that he knows she has not been to the Spirit World in quite some time.
