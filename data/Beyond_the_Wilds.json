While Jinora continues her search in the Wilds, Korra and Opal leave to inform President Raiko about the situation. Arriving at City Hall, they interrupt the world leaders as they debate which course of action to take against Kuvira. Varrick and Bolin arrive moments later as well and deliver the same message as Korra and Opal. A decision is made to strengthen the United Republic's borders, and Opal and Lin, apart from the others, decide to rescue their family in Zaofu by themselves. Meanwhile, Jinora is attacked by the vines as well but warns Korra by using her spirit projection, leading Korra and Mako to enter the Spirit Wilds in search of her. They find the unconscious captives and realize their souls are trapped in the Spirit World. Korra tries to meditate into the Spirit World, but she again finds herself incapacitated by visions of Zaheer. Korra decides to confront him in his prison. Deeming Kuvira's usurpation of power contrary to his intentions, the airbender opts to help her come to terms with her trauma and guides her into the Spirit World, where she successfully reconnects with Raava and retrieves the souls of Jinora, Ryu, and the captured tourists. Asami and Varrick are tasked with finding a defense against Kuvira's super weapon, and Bolin, trying to reconcile with Opal, chooses to join her and Lin on their secret mission to rescue their family.",
