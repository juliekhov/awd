Upon being asked about his preparations to rule the kingdom, Wu waved off Mako's question, stating that he would have ministers to deal with that while the two of them would merely \"live the life\" in the capital. As President Raiko joined their conversation and inquired how Wu was holding up, the prince ran off to scold at a Metalbending Police Force officer for erecting bleachers in the place where he intended to have people perform the \"Dance of the Badgermoles\". To emphasize his point, Wu promptly started dancing."

When he was introduced to Yin, Wu knelt before the old woman and bestowed her with a kiss on the hand, stating it to be an honor.
