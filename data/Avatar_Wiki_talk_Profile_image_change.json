The Iroh proposal was rejected in the beginning, but it was sound enough to be approved for discussion. The subsequent images proposed are more likely to have some quality that sets them apart from the current and initial proposals, so they could have better luck. In the case of Tarrlok, the later proposals are on average garnering more votes than the initial three, something that you neglected to mention when using it as an example. The bottom line is that the system we have now has helped us select better images over time for different articles and the longer an article has been around, the less likely it is for that article to need an image replacement. We shouldn\u2019t make a new rule based on the image proposal for Iroh (or Piandao), since that\u2019s an isolated case in the big picture. --AvatarRokus\u00a0Ghost (Message me \u2022 Read my fanon)   21:10, May 15, 2012 (UTC)",
