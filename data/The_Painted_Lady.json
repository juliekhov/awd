The village is in a deep depression with many villagers having fallen ill and a lack of food due to the polluted water. Katara wishes to help these people, but Sokka argues that the importance of their overall mission overrides all other situations that may arise. They purchase food from Xu, a shopkeeper who happens to bear a strong resemblance to Dock, save for the hat he dons. Before they leave, Katara gives one of the fish they bought to a small child; seeing him give it to his sick mother, she wishes she could do more."
