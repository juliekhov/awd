Shortly after, Bolin made his way out of the arena to get some fresh air and noticed the abandoned boat in Yue Bay. Deeming the sight to be suspicious, he investigated and discovered Lu and Gang tied and gagged in a nearby locker. After his gags were removed, Gang alerted Bolin that the waterbenders were after the president."
