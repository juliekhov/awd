      "text": "Ba Sing Se is arguably one of the oldest settlements in the world. A five-thousand-year-old map of the city was found in Wan Shi Tong's Library, which suggests it is at least that old. Early in its history, Ba Sing Se was a small subterranean city carved out of rocks by earthbenders. As the benders excavated further, they came across beautiful luminous crystals and began to mine them. The crystals currently serve as a common light source for Earth Kingdom inhabitants. Eventually, as the metropolis' expansion reached the surface, the catacombs were abandoned. The city continued to grow and eventually became the capital of the newly unified Earth Kingdom."

However, the ensuing chaos reduced parts of the city to ashes. A few weeks later, the situation in the city had calmed down as Kuvira and her army took control over the capital and placed it under military protection. Kuvira's actions also helped to initially improve the standard of living for the lower class residents. However, as time passed by, the citizens were forced to work as slave labor and dissenters were sent away. Kuvira lost control over the city after her attempted invasion of the United Republic of Nations lead to her imprisonment, with Wu subsequently being restored as the earth monarch. In the weeks following Kuvira's demise, the city recuperated sufficiently to be able to send shipments of food and supplies to Republic City in order to help the damaged city recover from Kuvira's attack."
