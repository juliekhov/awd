Wan used this to his advantage and placed his hand on the spirit portal, using the augmented spiritual energy to permanently bond his own spirit with Raava's. Due to this bond, the Avatar Spirit was created, making Wan the first Avatar in the reincarnation cycle, and the side effects of hosting a spirit were no more. With his newfound strength in the form of the Avatar State, Wan began attacking once more and managed to trap the dark spirit in an elemental cage, before imprisoning him in the hollow of the Tree of Time.",
