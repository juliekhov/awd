There he met and married Editha King, and together they had Clement George. His parents were killed in the same plane crash in 1953, and, from age nine, von Franckenstein was raised by British friends. He was educated at Eton College and served as a lieutenant in the Royal Scots Greys in the Middle East and Germany. He studied opera for about three years but was not good enough to be a professional, so he decided to become an actor. Until the time he came to US, he sang in nightclubs and had a lot of performing experience before getting into acting at the age of twenty-seven. Von Franckenstein holds both British and Austrian citizenship.",
