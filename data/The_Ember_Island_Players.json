      "text": "The play moves on through Book One: Water. Aang finds Momo, portrayed as a sock puppet in an air temple, which tells the audience \"Hi everybody! I love you!\" Sokka dresses as a Kyoshi Warrior with Suki's actress and wonders if the dress makes his butt look fat, which embarrasses Sokka and makes Suki giggle. In a scene depicting Omashu, King Bumi challenges Aang to save Katara and Sokka, and Katara faints from the ordeal. In the next scene, the pirates attack the team to get back the waterbending scroll, which actress Katara woefully says she only took it because \"it just gave [her] so much hope!\", annoying the real Katara. The Blue Spirit saves a captured Aang from Zuko, after which actress Aang lovingly declares \"My hero!\" and jumps onto his head to depart, which greatly embarrasses the real Aang and Zuko. Jet destroys a town by summoning a flood just to please Katara, who is overly infatuated with him. Sokka and Princess Yue kiss at the North Pole, with Sokka suspecting she ate pickled fish for dinner. Yue bids him farewell, as she has important \"moon duties\" to take care of and ascends into the sky, confirming that she did indeed eat pickled fish. This scene causes the real Sokka to shed tears and stuns the real Suki, who could not believe he kissed the Moon Spirit. The actress Aang dons a blue fish-suit and stomps on small models of Fire Nation cruisers, clutching and shaking a Zhao doll and cheering, \"The Avatar is back to save the day! Yaaaay!\" When the curtain falls over the scene, the audience, including Toph, bursts out in cheers, while the rest of Team Avatar groans in annoyance over the display."

    {
      "body": "In the preview of the play, while the events are true to the first season, the character portrayals and minor plot details are comically incorrect to make the team look bad. Examples:\n Katara is played by a much older, heavier, and more \"developed\" or \"robust\" actress and is portrayed as very melodramatic and exaggeratedly preoccupied with \"hope\", often bursting into tears and/or melodramatic speeches for the occasion for no apparent, logical, or comprehensible reason, an exaggeration based on the speech she gave to the imprisoned earthbenders in \"${link_0}\". All her actions also seem to be based on \"hope\". For example, when she and the others steal the ${link_1}, she claims that she did it because \"It gave me so much hope!\" She also deliberately waterbends actress Aang out of the iceberg when in reality, she finds Aang by accidentally waterbending while losing her temper at her brother's sexist remarks. She frees Aang with one of Sokka's weapons. The actress is also much more flirty than the real Katara. She seems to have romances with Jet and Zuko, but claims she only loves Aang \"like a little brother\", which disturbs the real Katara and Zuko and upsets the real Aang. She is also shown to be more attracted by Jet's 'bad-boy' attitude.\n Sokka's actor is incredibly thin and has buckteeth, he thinks only about food, mostly meat\u2014a comic exaggeration of Sokka referring to himself as \"the meat and sarcasm guy\". He wears Sokka's season two outfit.\n While the character is a boy, the actress portraying Aang is a woman who does not attempt to hide her gender, much to the real Aang's annoyance. She is also more of a trickster and is much more perky. Her glider resembles a fan and whenever he/she flies, she has a flamboyant posture that further exhibits her femininity.\n Toph is played by an extraordinarily muscular man with Toph's signature hairstyle. To symbolize Toph's blindness, the actor's hair covers his eyes, unlike Toph's eyes, which are not covered but which are very pale to emphasize the fact she is blind. Toph, in real life, \"sees\" with the vibrations all around her through her feet. In the play, the actor \"sees\" by releasing a sonic wave from his mouth. Also, much of Toph's background is removed, and the team just meets him/her when he/she comes out of the ground and announces him/herself as an earthbending master. The real Toph, however, does not seem bothered by this and is rather satisfied with her depiction.\n Jet is a character in the play and he is called \"so bad\" by the actress playing Katara with a flirty tone and has exaggeratedly spiky hair. He is shown to be using a flood to destroy the village rather than trying to save the village from the inhabiting Fire Nation soldiers. He chews on a red rose instead of a twig or piece of wheat. When he is shown hypnotized, the actor wears large glasses to make his eyes appear larger to emphasize the fact he is hypnotized and he has hooks on his hands instead of the hook swords he used in real life. His death's lack of clarity in the play refers to how his fate was never shown on screen. Also, in the play Jet was brainwashed by the Earth King, whereas in reality it was Long Feng and the Dai Li who hypnotized him, but that might have been a reference to the line \"The Earth King has invited you to Lake Laogai\", which triggers it.    ${link_2}'s scar is on the wrong side of his face.  \n Zuko's actor has the scar on the wrong eye and is consistently made fun of for his lack of honor. He is also mocked for being humorless and aggressive toward most of the other characters.\u00a0\n Rather than Zuko deciding that there's nothing further to gain from traveling together with his uncle, the reason Zuko and Iroh separated on the play is because Iroh criticized Zuko's hair leading to Zuko's decision that they should \"split up\". Also, Iroh's capture is not shown, instead Zuko pushes him over.\n Appa resembles more of a Chinese Southern Lion in festivals.\n Iroh is portrayed as a gluttonous moron, eating a whole cake. His love of tea is not mentioned and seems to instead be replaced with cakes. Also, he goads Zuko to side with him because treachery is \"more fun\". Ironically, this version of Iroh's enjoyment of cake is given to the character of Iroh in ${link_3}, although not to the comical extent shown here.\n Momo is a \"flying rabbit monkey\", talks and is portrayed as a hand puppet with a fake arm attached to the end to fool the audience, though only Aang's actress can wear it.\n The Blue Spirit is a separate entity from Zuko and also saves \"Aang\" from Zuko, though it was actually Zhao who captured Aang. The Blue Spirit is given a gargantuan head and a silly expression on his 'face'.\n Suki is accurate, though some physical details are slightly exaggerated, but to a lesser extent. She has no lines at all during the parts of the play that are shown on-camera.\n ${link_4}'s musculature is greatly over-exaggerated by a muscle suit worn by the actor and the feathers on his headdress are colored. Additionally, when he makes Aang complete a series of trials, both Aang and Sokka are seen being being chased around an arena by various objects while Katara is trapped in ${link_5} and subsequently faints in an exaggerated pose, whereas in real life both Sokka and Katara were trapped.\n Azula's physical characteristics are over-exaggerated, such as having long nails, excessive makeup, wearing pink, yellow and blue clothing and big hair. She is portrayed as being less cunning than the real Azula. Her speech pattern is also strangely bombastic, unlike the real-life Azula.\n ${link_6} is portrayed with hair covering her eyes, her hair in the style of ${link_7} and an unhappy face symbol on her chest, while ${link_8} is depicted as an overweight ballerina whose chi blocking is depicted by her simply kissing her fingers and touching her opponent, incapacitating them instantly. Actress Mai also keeps her stilettos in her hair buns, whereas the real Mai keeps her weapons in her clothing.\n Ozai is portrayed as a stereotypical villain, of the sort commonly seen in old vampire horror movies, with over-exaggerated facial features and even disappearing in a puff of smoke. His performance is reminiscent of Ming the Merciless.\n When Aang's actor on stage mentions they are flying above the Great Divide, Sokka's actor jokes that they should just \"keep flying\". This is poking fun at the fanbase's distaste for \"${link_9}\", as it had the lowest ratings of the entire series.\n Likewise, the audience yawning and falling asleep during the section of the play dealing with \"${link_10}\" is a reference to a vocal portion of the fanbase considering that episode to be \"boring\".",
