The group sneaked past Mako and Bolin's room and approached Korra's room. Ghazan and P'Li entered after Zaheer paralyzed the Avatar and Naga with shirshu-spit darts and the earthbender grabbed Korra. As they attempted to escape using the same way from which they had arrived, Bolin and Mako were alerted to their presence and engaged in a battle with them, Ghazan clutching the Avatar throughout. The battle soon attracted the attention of the guards, who used searchlights to locate the criminals, and Lin, Suyin, along with the twins Wei and Wing. The criminals were soon entrapped in metal panels, but Ghazan quickly transformed the ground surrounding the prison into a pool of lava, effectively creating a moat. While Zaheer was dragged out of the moat by a guard, Ghazan continued to hold it down while firing chunks of rock at Mako and Bolin, but when P'Li's combustion abilities were disabled, Lin and Suyin were able to rescue Korra. With their mission having failed, Zaheer quickly conjured a giant cloud of dust, allowing the gang to escape under its cover."
