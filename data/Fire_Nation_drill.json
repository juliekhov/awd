Due to its incredible size, it actually housed an entire brigade of Fire Nation engineers needed to make repairs and clean out the pipelines. Several metal support beams connected the protective outer shell of the drill to its engine inside. Rolling on massive tank treads, the drill moved each of its sections in a wave-like motion similar to an earthworm, using massive, backward-facing, hydraulic-powered spikes to provide traction and help drag the gargantuan machine forward. As the drill dug into an earthen structure, the rock was chewed up and turned into slurry, a mixture of rock and water that was dispensed into pipes and dumped out of the rear of the drill. The slurry served three important purposes: clearing away material; lubricating the drill; and reducing heat caused by friction with the rock, which could otherwise cause the tool to fail or even melt.",
