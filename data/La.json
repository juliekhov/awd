With her counterpart gone, La was left swimming frantically around in the pool. Aang, making eye contact with La, entered the Avatar State and walked into the water of the Spirit Oasis, where the Ocean Spirit started swimming around him. The two fused to form Koizilla, a colossal fish-like figure. Together, they quickly annihilated the Fire Nation land forces and navy fleet with their superior waterbending. When La noticed that Tui had been revived by Princess Yue's sacrifice, the spirit ceased his destructive rampage and separated from Aang, leaving him at the city's ice walls, and returned to the Spirit Oasis. On his way, he encountered a dueling Zhao and Zuko; to avenge the attack on Tui, the Ocean Spirit formed an arm out of water and dragged Zhao below, never to resurface again."
