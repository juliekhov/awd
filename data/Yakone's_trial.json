There, he met his later wife, and had two sons, Noatak and Tarrlok, whom he would instruct in the art of bloodbending in the hopes that they would carry out his revenge against the Avatar for having stripped him of his bending. However, Noatak, tired of his father's merciless treatment, came to the conclusion that all bending arts were destructive and oppressive, which led to him assuming the alias of Amon and starting the Anti-bending Revolution to end all bending in the world."
