Back home, Naga slept on the floor of Korra's room, though awoke with concern when her master startled awake from a nightmare. When Korra decided three weeks later to visit Katara to help her recovery process, Naga attended every physical therapy session the Avatar underwent. Nearly six months later, when Korra was growing frustrated over her situation, Naga was used by Katara as a goal for Korra to reach. When the Avatar made it to the animal, the polar bear dog lovingly bent her head down to return the embrace Korra was giving her. When Korra decided to return to Republic City a year and half later, Naga was left in the care of Tonraq and Senna. As Korra sailed away from Harbor City, Naga watched her go from the docks, howling sadly to the sky."
