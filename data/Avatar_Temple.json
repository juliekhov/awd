However, Avatar Roku had sensed the looming danger and provided protection for Aang; the doors of the sanctuary opened to reveal Avatar Roku manifested through Aang's body. Roku exhibited his firebending prowess, defeating the opposing forces and freeing Sokka, Katara, Shyu, and Zuko from the chains that bound them. The Avatar destroyed the temple permanently by bending the magma from underneath the structure. As the winter solstice passed, the connection between Aang and Roku was broken, and Team Avatar escaped while the temple was consumed by the lava."
