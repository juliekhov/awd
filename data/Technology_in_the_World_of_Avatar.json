The animals that were used for transportation changed with location. Nobility traveled long distances by riding on animal-drawn carriages. Boats during this era were primitive as well, being limited to cutters, catamarans, barges, canoes, skiffs, and ferries. The Air Nomads traveled on their flying bison and flew around with their gliders."
