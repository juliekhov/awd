He asks her what kind of game she is playing with Bolin, as he is convinced that she is only going out with his brother to get back at him. Korra honestly refutes that accusation by pointing out that they are only having fun, while wondering why Mako would care anyway. As Mako says that he is only acting like that in protection of his little brother, something starts to dawn on Korra and she calls his reaction out to be sprouting from his jealousy, claiming that Mako does have feelings for her. Attempting to get him to admit to his true feelings, their argument quickly gets out of hand with them shouting at each other before storming off inside the arena."

Noticing this, Bolin tries to motivate his teammates and steps up his attacks, narrowly notching the second round. After the third round ends in a tie, Bolin, seeing Mako is not focused, overrules Mako's decision to be the fighter in the tiebreaker and takes his place instead, thus choosing earth as the element with which to fight. In a quick but fierce match, he successfully defeats Chang, the Boar-q-pines' earthbender, clinching the match for the Fire Ferrets, and securing a place for the Fire Ferrets in the semifinal.",
