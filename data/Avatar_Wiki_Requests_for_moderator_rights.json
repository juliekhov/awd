I admit there have been times where I've reported comments that were possibly less serious and didn't need any action, but most of these occurred when I was a new user and didn't have much experience in this area. I don't usually go into forums asking people to get back on-topic or asking them to do something, as I don't feel I have any authority in the forums yet. However, I have, through my more than four years here given out warnings for comments, such as this one and this one, the latter dating back to 2014. I have reported a few instances on the admin noticeboard before, and I think I've shown responsibility as a user during my years of being a rollback user. Tono555  13:53, September 26, 2018 (UTC)",
