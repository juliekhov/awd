She later used her airship to rescue airbenders from the Earth Queen. After escaping Ba Sing Se, Team Avatar and Lin took her airship in search of more airbenders. The first stop in their journey was Zaofu."

There is also a cockpit from which metalbenders launch metal wires from the inside of the ship, enabling the crew to apprehend criminals and fugitives from the safety of the craft.
