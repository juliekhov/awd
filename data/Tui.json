The Fire Nation Navy arrived at the capital city, destroying its protective locks and dams to steadily advance into the city's center. Determined to make a legend of himself, Zhao lead his personal guard into the royal palace to kill the Moon Spirit, whose mortal existence he had learned from Wan Shi Tong's Library. Zhao captured Tui, causing the spiritual equivalent of a lunar eclipse and removing the power of all waterbenders. General Iroh intervened and threatened Zhao that any harm inflicted on the spirit would be unleashed on him tenfold. After appearing to head Iroh's warning, Zhao released Tui back into the water of the Oasis. However Zhao then abruptly murdered Tui with a blast of fire bending, much to the horror of Katara, Aang, and Iroh. Tui's death lead to a lapse in spiritual balance and water bending ceased to exist. In anger Iroh lashed out at Zhao and incapacitated his guards. Zhao himself was able to escape during the fighting, and started back towards the coast, where he was eventually confronted and defeated by Zuko. Meanwhile Aang entered the Avatar State and became one entity with La; defeating the Fire Nation invasion and forcing the remaining ships away to sea."
