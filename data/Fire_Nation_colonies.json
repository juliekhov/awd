      "text": "In order to restore peace and balance in the world, the Harmony Restoration Movement was launched with the aim of transferring the Fire Nation colonials back to their home nation. However, a year after the Hundred Year War's conclusion, new disputes arose over the existence of the colonies on Earth Kingdom territory and ignited fresh tensions with the Fire Nation, threatening to devolve into war between the two countries and civil war within the Fire Nation itself. The resulting outcry necessitated the intervention of Team Avatar on behalf of Fire Lord Zuko. Realizing that the conflict could never be truly solved, as the colonials were no longer Earth Kingdom and Fire Nation divided, though rather a new people, Avatar Aang and Fire Lord Zuko abandoned the Harmony Restoration Movement. Instead, the colonies were led into autonomy by new coalition governments that were elected in 102 AG. Eventually, the colonies were transformed into the United Republic of Nations."
