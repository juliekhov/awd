      "text": "President Raiko is in the middle of a meeting with Lin Beifong inside the police headquarters, when Mako walks in and reveals his breakthrough about the bombing case. He receives bad advice from Lu and Gang to take the information to Beifong right away, for which he is reproached. Mako gives the information to the two detectives about the culprit being a member of the Agni Kai Triad, and he asks if they found out anything about the remote that he found, but they dismiss his inquiry, convinced that the North is responsible. Mako returns to his desk as the president walks out and is approached by him. Raiko recognizes Mako's efforts as a rookie and asks him if he has any information about anything the Avatar and Varrick are plotting. As Raiko begins to walk away, Mako calls him back and hesitantly reveals that there is something that he should know."
