Cut to a close-up of Korra's face as she sniffs twice, and eventually opens her eyes. Switch to a side shot of the three children and Korra, as the latter leans forward to look to them: they are all sitting tranquilly. Upon seeing this, Korra sits up straight again, taking on the meditating posture again. The floorboard squeaks with every movement she makes. Switch to broader side shot.",

Cut to the guard below, walking off to his right. The moment he turns, Korra jumps out of the window and lands softly in the middle of the courtyard. Switch to a frontal shot of her as she is running away, and an aerial shot the moment she reaches the end of the rock the island is built on and jumps off it without hesitation. Cut to a point of view looking up as she softens the impact of her fall by raising the water with her waterbending.

As she slide-lands against the wall, she jumps up in the same movement, spinning rapidly around and dries the water off her with her bending. She walks away and turns into a hallway. As she passes a large room, her curiosity is peeked. The camera rapidly moves back from a frontal shot of Korra toward the back of the room, revealing that it is a pro-bending gym. Among the equipment are punching bags, dumbbell weights, nets, pommel horses, and earth disks. Cut back briefly toward Korra's grinning, excited face as she goes inside without hesitation, before changing back to the wider shot, showing how she walks up to the middle of the room and looks around at everything.",
