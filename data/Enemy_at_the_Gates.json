Suyin refuses, however, despite repeated warnings from both Kuvira and Korra, who has traveled to Zaofu with Jinora, Ikki, and Meelo. Meanwhile, Varrick's conscience begins to trouble him as he continues his work on spirit vine technology, and he briefly refuses to develop it further until Kuvira threatens to kill him. After a confrontation with the Beifong clan, Bolin again begins to question Kuvira's methods, leading him to join forces with Varrick and Zhu Li in an attempt to escape. They are apprehended by Baatar Jr., however, and while Zhu Li pledges her loyalty to Kuvira, Bolin is sent to a reeducation camp, and Varrick is forced to continue his experiments. Korra tries to talk Kuvira out of taking Zaofu, but Kuvira gives Korra the job of talking Suyin into surrendering Zaofu.

Suyin refuses, however, despite repeated warnings from both Kuvira and Korra, who has traveled to Zaofu with Jinora, Ikki, and Meelo. Meanwhile, Varrick's conscience begins to trouble him as he continues his work on spirit vine technology, and he briefly refuses to develop it further until Kuvira threatens to kill him. After a confrontation with the Beifong clan, Bolin again begins to question Kuvira's methods, leading him to join forces with Varrick and Zhu Li in an attempt to escape.

Noting the metal city is doomed, Varrick announces his intention to escape to Republic City in order to warn them about Kuvira's spirit-vine superweapon. While Bolin ponders their best option, he is suddenly zapped by a bolt of electricity from Baatar Jr.'s mecha suit, who, along with the two other guards, has caught up with the runaways.

Meanwhile, in an attempt to help out, Varrick has engaged the electric weapon of his own suit but accidentally knocks down Zhu Li. Without her protection, one of the soldiers manages to ensnare his suit, forcing him to flee on foot. He climbs up a hill, chased by one of the suits, but manages to reach the top safely since Zhu Li comes to his aid. She struggles to hold off her two opponents, but the odds are tipped in their favor when Bolin creates a gully of lava, which melts the guards' suits and allows Bolin to trap the escaping pilots with his earthbending. Their victory is short-lived, however, as Baatar Jr. emerges atop the cliff and forces them to surrender by dangling a captured Varrick over the edge by his head. The businessman promptly blames Zhu Li for his predicament, enraging his assistant.",
