They were caught and subsequently imprisoned, where the group was confronted by Hiroshi Sato, who told them that he had intercepted General Iroh's wire to Bumi and knew exactly where his fleet was hiding. Seeking a means of escaping, the General asked Bolin if he was a metalbender, but he answered that he was not, much to Iroh's disappointment. Naga, however, arrived on the scene shortly afterward and broke the three out of their cell, allowing them to head toward the airstrips."
