The film was nominated for eight Golden Raspberry Awards, a parody of the Oscars where accolades are given to the worst films of the year, and won five: Worst Picture, Worst Director, Worst Screenplay, Worst Supporting Actor (for Jackson Rathbone), and Worst Eye-Gouging Misuse of 3-D. Worst Sequel, Remake, or Adaptation and Worst Screen Couple/Ensemble were lost to Sex and the City 2, while Worst Supporting Actress went to Jessica Alba. It was nominated with several other awards including Choice Summer Movie for the 2010 Teen Choice Awards, International Film Music Critics Association (IFMCA), the 32nd Young Artist Award, the 2011 MTV Movie Awards, and the 3rd Annual Coming of Age Movie Awards of which, Noah Ringer won for the Best Actor. Many fans of the original series have demanded a remake or reboot of the film. Fans of the film itself have banded together in support of the movie at various sites, many of them asked to release an extended cut of the movie."

In a later interview with IGN in 2015, he once again defended his movie by emphasizing that he made it for its original audience, \"nine and ten-year olds\", rather than \"[betraying] the innocence of the piece\" by \"[doing] the Transformers version and have Megan Fox.\" This explanation, however, was in turn attacked by Mark Harrison on Den Of Geek, who threw out Shyamalan's \"it was for kids\" excuse, pointing out that while the original series was for children due to its bright, colorful, and funny nature, \"None of that is true of the film version\", and that the movie \"went alarmingly and hilariously wrong on its way to the big screen.\" Despite the harsh criticism, Harrison did praise Shyamalan for standing by his film rather than \"throwing a previous disappointment under the bus to sell his next project as better\".",
