He had a role in the 1976 \"Baa Baa Black Sheep\" episode Prisoners of War as a downed Japanese fighter pilot in the Pacific. Kusatsu has also performed in Lou Grant, as a guest star in an episode on Japanese internment in the U.S.; Golden Land, a 1988 Hollywood-set drama based on a William Faulkner story; and the 1993 AIDS drama And the Band Played On. He appeared in four M*A*S*H episodes and later starred in the short-lived mid-1990s ABC series All American Girl, the first familiar East Asian sitcom in the U.S.",
