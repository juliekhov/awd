      "text": "After the end of the Hundred Year War, the tundra tanks continued service as the primary military vehicle of the Fire Nation. When the Harmony Restoration Movement escalated into an open conflict between the Earth Kingdom and Fire Nation, Fire Lord Zuko employed a small but effective task force to defend Yu Dao from the Earth Kingdom Army. This task force also included seven tundra tanks. However, the tanks were disabled by Toph Beifong's metalbending before the battle began, forcing the tank crews to fight on foot."

The former are primarily used over icy terrain, thus in mountains or the poles. The latter are suitable for almost all other environments, including deserts, grasslands, and urban areas. The steam engines that power the tundra tanks are extremely efficient and durable engines; extreme climatic conditions cannot harm them, while they allow the tank to scale even sheer rock cliffs using the two grappling hooks on the front end. A particularly notable feature of the tank is the unique rotating cabin, capable of righting the tank should it get flipped over. This feature is particularly useful when combating earthbenders or airbenders. At the bottom of the tank is an escape hatch used when the vehicle sustains severe damage and the operators must leave.",

Nevertheless, the firebending is lethal to infantry and cavalry, and can even knock heavy tanks on their sides or back after a series of stronger blasts.
