To do this, airbending gates are used. Airbending is used to set the gates in motion, either by an airbending master or by a fellow pupil who has completed the exercise. The goal of the exercise is to maneuver through the gates without touching them; the pupil is required to learn to switch directions at a moment's notice in order to get to the other side. Forcing one's way through the panels will result in them hitting the pupil while they attempt to traverse it.",
