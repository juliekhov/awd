Mako entreated him about the whereabouts of Bolin, but Skoochy stated that his memory was a little foggy, and suggested that he would need money to remember. Mako obliged his request, and in return, Skoochy explained that Bolin had been doing some sort of \"monkey-rat circus\" at about noon, but held out from revealing any more. Mako gave Skoochy another yuan and the orphan continued, informing Mako that Bolin had left with Shady Shin after Shin offered him a great deal of money, giving Mako and Korra a lead on finding Bolin."
