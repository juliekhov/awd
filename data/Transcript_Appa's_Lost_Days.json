Appa flies to a cactus, scaring away a jackalope. He eats the cactus, but roars in pain and spits it out due to the sharp prickles. Cut to Appa flying again, this time more wearied. He sniffs for food and flies toward the Si Wong Rock. Cut to the buzzard wasp nests, which Appa flies into and starts eating, but quickly flies out when the buzzard wasps start attacking. Appa uses airbending to knock down all of the buzzard wasps, which scatter afterward. Appa lands, panting, and licks the honey on his feet and arms until he stops and begins to rest.",

The boar-q-pine charges at Appa, knocking him into a tree which falls down. Appa grabs the tree with his mouth and throws it at the boar-q-pine, who jumps over the trunk and charges at Appa. Appa stands on his rear legs, grabs the charging boar-q-pine, and throws it to the side. The shot changes to a farther distance where the dust from the sliding boar-q-pine rises above the tree tops and scatters some birds. In a closer shot, the boar-q-pine stops sliding and runs away, squealing. Appa pants and grabs a quill from his leg, roaring in pain as the camera zooms back.",
