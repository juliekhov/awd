Team Avatar was there by coincidence, since Aang had just undergone a trial for killing Chin in his past life as Avatar Kyoshi and was found guilty by the town's mayor when Kyoshi confessed to the crime. When Aang, still dressed in Kyoshi's clothes, approached Kahchi, the latter readied his guan dao. Aang leaned forward and extended his arms out behind him, holding one of Kyoshi's fans, which he opened as he ran. He spun aside out of the rhino's way at the last moment and used the fan to airbend Kahchi out of his saddle over the cliff."
