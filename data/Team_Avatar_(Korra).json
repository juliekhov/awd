Korra led a peace march through the city, during which the Southern Water Tribe Cultural Center was bombed. The next day, as Mako began investigating the bombing, Korra and Varrick met with President Raiko, who refused to send the United Forces to help the South, preferring a diplomatic solution. Per Varrick's suggestion, the Avatar went to see General Iroh directly to win support for the South, but was prevented from doing so by Raiko, who had been informed by a reluctant Mako about Korra's plan. Ultimately, the group split up, each attempting to support the South in their own way. Mako continued his investigation, believing that the Agni Kai Triad was responsible, but decided to break up with Korra upon being confronted for informing the President about her plan. Asami and Varrick planned to ship mecha tanks to the South in order to aid the rebels and prevent Future Industries from going into bankruptcy. The businessman concurrently worked with Bolin to create a propaganda mover that would shift public opinion toward support for the South. Korra, using a speedboat supplied by Varrick, traveled to the Fire Nation to seek the Fire Lord's support, but was attacked by Desna and Eska. Following a brief battle, Korra was consumed by a massive dark spirit."

When they found him, the brothers pursued him all the way to the monorail, where Kai managed to exit the car just before departure, leaving the brothers stranded on the express train to the Lower Ring. Having had their money and passports stolen by Kai, Mako and Bolin were unable to return to the Upper Ring. After spending the nights on a dumpster site in the street, the now hungry brothers started walking. Passing a fruit stand, Bolin suggested stealing some fruit with their old \"fruit stand scam\". Mako, deeming the fruit to be inedible, refused, which offended the vendor. When the young man assaulted the brothers, having deemed them fruit thieves, his father returned, who recognized Mako and Bolin to be his nephews, the children of his brother San. The two brothers were invited to have a meal with their family, meeting their grandmother, Yin, for the first time in their lives."
