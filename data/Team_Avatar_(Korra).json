Although Mako wanted to confront the guard with the evidence, Aiwei prevented him from doing so and Team Avatar resided to search the battlefield for more clues. As Mako continued to voice his doubts about Hong Li's guilt, Varrick appeared and suggested that the evidence might have been too overwhelming to be true, reminding Mako how easy it was to frame someone by claiming someone to be guilty and planting the evidence. As a result, the firebender deduced that Aiwei was the only one capable of doing that and the team set out to search his home, where they discover a secret basement hidden behind a bookcase. Before they were able to investigate further, the advisor returned home. Noticing small changes in his home, most notably the bookcase having been slid open, Aiwei realized he had been found out and metalbent a wall between him and the team to provide cover.

Under the supervising eyes of Team Avatar, Aiwei eventually pointed to Hong Li as the culprit, an accusation that was strengthened by overwhelming incriminating evidence found in the young man's quarters. Although Mako wanted to confront the guard with the evidence, Aiwei prevented him from doing so and Team Avatar resided to search the battlefield for more clues. As Mako continued to voice his doubts about Hong Li's guilt, Varrick appeared and suggested that the evidence might have been too overwhelming to be true, reminding Mako how easy it was to frame someone by claiming someone to be guilty and planting the evidence. As a result, the firebender deduced that Aiwei was the only one capable of doing that and the team set out to search his home, where they discover a secret basement hidden behind a bookcase.

However, since the Red Lotus did not know how many of them there were, Suyin came up with a plan to use that to their advantage: while Mako, Bolin, and Asami took the airship to the Northern Air Temple to ensure the airbenders were there, Tonraq and the Metal Clan would scale Laghima's Peak and be ready to rush to Korra's aid as soon as the airbenders were brought to safety."

With the help of an airbender stealth team, Korra managed to kidnap Baatar Jr. and interrogated him at the Future Industries factory. Although she managed to force him to contact Kuvira to talk her out of her conquest, Team Avatar and their allies had to run for their lives when Kuvira traced Baatar Jr.'s radio call toward the factory and blew it up with her spirit energy cannon. The team managed to survive the explosion and emerged from the rubble with everyone else when Bolin lifted a large piece of concrete. Standing among the rubble, they split once more, with the benders attempting to stop Kuvira's advance, while Asami and Varrick would try to modify the prototypes of the hummingbird mecha suits in order to be able to offer air support."
