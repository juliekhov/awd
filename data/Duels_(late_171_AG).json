The Avatar angrily yelled at Zaheer they had a deal, and promptly blast air at him. Korra was fighting with Zaheer, blasting fire at him, which the airbender deflected. She kicked up a rock, but Zaheer ducked and attempted to get close to the Avatar again. Korra continued blasting earth and fire at him, but she found herself restrained by the chains P'Li put on her earlier. Zaheer managed to land a blow and knocked Korra out. As P'Li went away to fight the metalbenders, he brought Korra onto the airship, but Tonraq also made it up the mountain and intervened. His daughter fell off the ramp of the airship, but he used a water tendril to catch and save her. Back on top, Korra promptly blasted fire at Zaheer, who created an air shield in front of him, but was still blown back. Tonraq cut the tethers of the airship, which floated away and yelled at Zaheer that he had no where to go. Tonraq and Korra teamed up, and Korra bent a rock at Zaheer, followed swiftly by her father, who used his water tendrils in an attempt to knock the airbender down. Zaheer blasted away at Tonraq and Korra, and the Chief was having trouble staying on his feet. But just as he was knocked down, Korra came to his aid and, in spite of her chains, managed to dodge all of Zaheer's attack and launched a fissure his way. He used this as a ramp to jettison himself into the air and get close to Korra, but she had accounted for this. As she jumped out of the way, her father was right behind her and blasted the airbender with a stream of water, knocking him back. As Zaheer was cartwheeling back, Korra launched another fissure right in his path. He tripped, and Tonraq phase-changed his water tendril into an ice dagger, but Zaheer dodged it at the last second. The dagger shattered, and the airbender used this moment of Tonraq's distraction to create a tornado, and pick up the Chief. Sarcastically remarking to give his regards to the Earth Queen, Zaheer threw Tonraq off the mountain as Korra watched in horror. Having done this, Zaheer heard a hollow, metallic explosion, which he knew meant P'Li's death. The Avatar noticed the airbenders distraction, and sent a blast of fire his way. He dodged this though, just like the subsequent ones Korra shot at him. Zaheer blasted her down on the ground, which knocked her out. He picked Korra up and saw his airship floating freely in the distance. As Lin and Suyin also made it to the top of the mountain and told him it's over, Zaheer began reciting Guru Laghima's poem. He calmly proceeded as the Beifong sisters continued ordering him to put Korra down. When he finished, he took a small step back and fell off the cliff, much to Lin and Suyin's horror. As they ran to the edge, they saw the airbender flying, and tried to restrain him with their cables, but they missed. Leaving the sisters in disbelief, he flew away with Korra on his shoulder, past Ghazan and Ming-Hua, who remarked he doesn't need a ride. Meanwhile, it turned out that Kuvira caught Tonraq who could do nothing but watch as Zaheer flew off with his daughter.",

After breaking free of her chains, she lifted four boulders and spun them around, before trying to crush the Red Lotus members with them. Zaheer flew away through a small cave and Korra followed him, propelling herself with firebending. The airbender made it through the small opening in the mountainside unscathed, while the enraged Avatar destroyed the entire opening on her way out. She launched boulders at Zaheer, which he deflected, but before he could fully recover, Korra tackled him mid-air. He blasted Korra against a rock column, but she got back up and spun around another column and broke the top off in an attempt to crush Zaheer. He flew between two columns, and she bent these two together, but he made it through. Korra kept shooting rocks at Zaheer, but he continually managed to dodge them. He knocked the Avatar down, but she got up and took an enormous boulder with her and tried to crush Zaheer between it and a mountain, but he evaded it. Korra landed in a pond, and shot at her opponent with water, and she eventually hit his leg, freezing it in a block of ice. This impeded the flying airbender, and Korra moved in for a good shot, but the venom started to have its effect and she was unable to continue fighting because of this. Zaheer broke free from the ball of ice, and flew up to Korra, who made a crash-landing. Meanwhile, far below, ${link_0} wanted to help Korra, but is stopped by ${link_1}, who's telling him he doesn't stand a chance against Zaheer.

      "text": "After Zaheer administered the venom to Korra, she was forced into the Avatar State. She ripped one of the chains from the wall, and attempted to crush Zaheer with it, but he jumped out of its way. Korra then knocked out Ming-Hua with it. Ghazan tried to kill her by shooting up a large volume of lava, but she used her airbending to send it back to the earthbender, who also quickly jumped out of the way. After breaking free of her chains, she lifted four boulders and spun them around, before trying to crush the Red Lotus members with them. Zaheer flew away through a small cave and Korra followed him, propelling herself with firebending. The airbender made it through the small opening in the mountainside unscathed, while the enraged Avatar destroyed the entire opening on her way out. She launched boulders at Zaheer, which he deflected, but before he could fully recover, Korra tackled him mid-air. He blasted Korra against a rock column, but she got back up and spun around another column and broke the top off in an attempt to crush Zaheer. He flew between two columns, and she bent these two together, but he made it through. Korra kept shooting rocks at Zaheer, but he continually managed to dodge them. He knocked the Avatar down, but she got up and took an enormous boulder with her and tried to crush Zaheer between it and a mountain, but he evaded it. Korra landed in a pond, and shot at her opponent with water, and she eventually hit his leg, freezing it in a block of ice. This impeded the flying airbender, and Korra moved in for a good shot, but the venom started to have its effect and she was unable to continue fighting because of this. Zaheer broke free from the ball of ice, and flew up to Korra, who made a crash-landing. Meanwhile, far below, Kai wanted to help Korra, but is stopped by Lin, who's telling him he doesn't stand a chance against Zaheer. Jinora has another idea and takes the initiative to create a massive tornado, when the other airbenders join in and help her."
