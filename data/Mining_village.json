Most buildings are identical to each other; they all have a green roof, yellow walls, few windows, and a single wooden door at the front entrance. The windows have boards attached to them, which can be used to block light when necessary. The village's centerpiece building is a large palace-like structure found off to one side. It has intricate decorations and is a classic example of Earth Kingdom architecture. A large, grand entrance is at the back of its front porch, which is supported by golden beams and pillars. The building is several stories tall, and has much floor space, making it the largest structure in the village. The uppermost floor has a small balcony that overlooks the entire village. Shingles cover the building's curved roof, which is green."
