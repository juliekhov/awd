Unwilling to engage in hopeless combat on a prison rig without earth to bend, he did not favor open resistance with his captors; even Katara's hopeful persuasion to mutiny failed to goad him to battle the Fire Nation soldiers. However, when Aang provided a source of earth and his son Haru showed a willingness to fight, Tyro shed his reluctance and helped lead the fight for freedom. After their victory at the rig, Tyro stated his intentions to defeat the Fire Nation Army and take back his village, which was eventually fulfilled."
