Coursing over the icy tundra, riding an air and waterspout respectively, the two Avatars trade blows, barraging each other with the elements they command. Unalaq eventually manages to usurp Korra's ice shield and use it to encase her in ice. Throwing her onto the ground, the ice shatters, leaving her dazed and vulnerable to be trapped in a fissure in the permafrost. Attempting to crush the Avatar, he orders her to give up. As the ground closes up over her, Raava reaches out to Korra. Telling her not to Vaatu win, to give in to ten thousand years of darkness, Raava reminds Korra that she is the Avatar. Reinvigorating herself by entering the Avatar State, Korra blasts her way out of the hole with firebending. Telling Unalaq that his victory is impossible, they resume the battle."
