Unconvinced, the two refuse to release the brothers, but Bolin begins to sob; when a curious Eska questions him, he tells her that he is distraught over the fact that the untimely end of the world will prevent him from being with Eska again. He apologizes to Eska for leaving her, expressing regret that they were unable to \"rekindle the dying ember\" of their love into a \"big fire of love flames\". Moved by Bolin's show of emotion, Eska kisses him and releases the brothers. Once out of earshot of the others, Mako compliments his brother's acting abilities, with Bolin somewhat skeptical that his show of emotion was completely acting. As they emerge into the physical world, they witness both Korra and Unalaq battling each other in their Avatar States. Korra is able to bring Unalaq down, but when their struggle pulls them within arm's length of each other, Vaatu leaves Unalaq's body and tears Raava from Korra's body, and she falls to the ground, most of her energy gone.
