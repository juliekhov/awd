      "body": "Korra traveled back to Air Temple Island with Asami, where she retreated to the meditation pavilion. Lost in thought, she was approached by Asami and offered a cup of tea against the cold. When asked if she was okay, Korra revealed that she had been thinking about Toph's statement of the Avatar being redundant and it being basically pointless to try and stop Kuvira. As Asami firmly told her that was a ridiculous notion, Korra stated that she did not believe it either at first, writing it off as Toph being cranky, though after reflecting on her past, she came to see reason in the statement, as she concluded that the world seemed to always be out of balance, regardless of her actions. To clarify her point, Korra explained that she had grown up anxious to be the Avatar and change things in the world, though meeting Amon had shattered her hopes when he had taken hers and others' bending away. Although Asami countered her self-deprecating thoughts by highlighting all the good things she had accomplished, such as decapitating the ${link_0} movement and allowing for free election to be held in the ${link_1}, which increased the representation of nonbenders, Korra remained distant, as the hope she had given people had not last due to Unalaq's actions. She felt guilty over having betrayed Tenzin due to her uncle and for opening the portals, which threw both the human and ${link_2} into chaos. She blamed herself for the creation of the Dark Avatar and the destruction of Raava. Korra countered Asami's uplifting words of her restoring the Air Nation and causing a positive shift in the world by pointing out that by bringing airbending back, Zaheer had also been given the power and used it to nearly kill her and cause the world to be more out of balance than ever. Exclaiming that nothing had changed, Korra was surprised to find that Tenzin agreed with her. After the airbending master explained that while she would always have new enemies to face, he pointed out that she had learned from her past enemies and bettered herself, maturing from a hot-headed and slightly selfish person to a thoughtful young woman who placed the needs of others before her own and had become an inspiration to the world.

      "text": "Korra traveled back to Air Temple Island with Asami, where she retreated to the meditation pavilion. Lost in thought, she was approached by Asami and offered a cup of tea against the cold. When asked if she was okay, Korra revealed that she had been thinking about Toph's statement of the Avatar being redundant and it being basically pointless to try and stop Kuvira. As Asami firmly told her that was a ridiculous notion, Korra stated that she did not believe it either at first, writing it off as Toph being cranky, though after reflecting on her past, she came to see reason in the statement, as she concluded that the world seemed to always be out of balance, regardless of her actions. To clarify her point, Korra explained that she had grown up anxious to be the Avatar and change things in the world, though meeting Amon had shattered her hopes when he had taken hers and others' bending away. Although Asami countered her self-deprecating thoughts by highlighting all the good things she had accomplished, such as decapitating the Equalist movement and allowing for free election to be held in the United Republic, which increased the representation of nonbenders, Korra remained distant, as the hope she had given people had not last due to Unalaq's actions. She felt guilty over having betrayed Tenzin due to her uncle and for opening the portals, which threw both the human and Spirit World into chaos. She blamed herself for the creation of the Dark Avatar and the destruction of Raava. Korra countered Asami's uplifting words of her restoring the Air Nation and causing a positive shift in the world by pointing out that by bringing airbending back, Zaheer had also been given the power and used it to nearly kill her and cause the world to be more out of balance than ever. Exclaiming that nothing had changed, Korra was surprised to find that Tenzin agreed with her. After the airbending master explained that while she would always have new enemies to face, he pointed out that she had learned from her past enemies and bettered herself, maturing from a hot-headed and slightly selfish person to a thoughtful young woman who placed the needs of others before her own and had become an inspiration to the world.

Following Kuvira's voice, Korra walked into a trap, however, finding herself right in front of the spirit energy cannon that had been thrown free of its arm and landed inside the forest as well. She dove out of the way of the beam and when the cannon started to charge itself with the vines of the Spirit Wilds, causing the beam to overload, she implored Kuvira to shut it down.

      "text": "Recovering from the impact, Korra created a way out with her earthbending and supported Kuvira to exit the suit. Laying the metalbender down, she sternly told her that it was over and that she needed to call off her army and surrender to President Raiko. Before she could continue, however, she was knocked back when Kuvira hit her with a rock. By the time Korra had risen to her feet again, Kuvira had vanished inside the Spirit Wilds. She gave chase and while searching the forest, she called out to the other woman to give up and end the madness. Following Kuvira's voice, Korra walked into a trap, however, finding herself right in front of the spirit energy cannon that had been thrown free of its arm and landed inside the forest as well. She dove out of the way of the beam and when the cannon started to charge itself with the vines of the Spirit Wilds, causing the beam to overload, she implored Kuvira to shut it down. The cannon no longer reacted to manual commands, however, and when the energy beam threatened to kill Kuvira, Korra jumped in front of her. Entering the Avatar State, she held the beam at bay, though the enormous surge of energy expanded around them and exploded."

Noticing their surroundings, Kuvira asked Korra if they were dead, to which Korra explained that the energy from the spirit energy cannon had torn open a new passage to the Spirit World and had blasted them in there. When Kuvira demanded to know why Korra would risk her life after everything she had put her through, the Avatar explained that she saw a lot of herself in the metalbender, stating that they were both fierce and determined to succeed, sometimes even without thinking things through. As Kuvira mused that nothing went as she had desired, Korra pointed out that she had brought herself down by tampering with the spirit vines and acting like a dictator. When the metalbender snapped that she had been merely trying to help her people in the absence of the Avatar, Korra understood that Kuvira had only been trying to create a place where she and her people would never have to feel vulnerable again and sympathized with the hardships that come from a life as an orphan. She explained that while she still had her parents, she knew how it felt to live in fear, disclosing that she would have done anything to feel in control again after she had been poisoned by Zaheer.",
