This was improvised from the episode \"The Guru\", where Guru Pathik told him let go of his guilt to open his water chakra. In the novelization, the Dragon Spirit instead told Aang he may have to choose between his feelings for Katara and being the Avatar, which is in reference of Guru Pathik telling Aang to let go of worldly attachments, i.e. his feelings for Katara, to open the seventh chakra."
