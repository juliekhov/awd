A proud man, Pakku took his customs and culture quite seriously, though could be placated if sufficiently shocked or forced to see another's point of view. His greatest pride appeared to be his students, among whom he counted Katara as his shining achievement as an instructor based on her rapid mastery of the art of waterbending.",
