The army employed hundreds of foot soldiers and a contingent of tanks to overwhelm the defenders in their almost inaccessible mountain fortress, accessible by only a single path. Despite considerable resistance from the refugees, their air forces, and Team Avatar, the tanks soon reached the walls of the temple. The battle ultimately ended in a defeat, however, as the defenders, in a last desperate act, intentionally caused a massive natural gas explosion under the temple; both the cliffs and path to the temple were destroyed, while almost all Fire Nation forces were killed in the explosion. The confrontation was not a complete loss, however, as War Minister Qin discovered an abandoned hot air balloon during the battle, technology that would give the Fire Nation a major advantage during the final stages of the war."

Even though his troops advanced quickly, the Fire Nation Army arrived after the Earth Kingdom Army. When both armies were about to attack each other, Sokka and Toph appeared from one of the tanks which they had secretly hijacked before, and upon Sokka's command, Toph metalbent all the screws from the tundra tanks around them, essentially disabling them. Fire Lord Zuko, outraged and determined, ordered his men to start fighting on foot and with the cavalry, beginning the battle for Yu Dao. In order to avoid unnecessary bloodshed, Team Avatar intervened, fighting both the Fire Nation and Earth Kingdom troops. However, the Fire Nation Army, even without the aid of heavy weapons, was able to withstand both the Earth Kingdom Army with its still operational heavy tanks and the elite fighters of Team Avatar. Nevertheless, Team Avatar's involvement resulted in a ceasefire and an agreement between Earth King Kuei and Fire Lord Zuko, allowing both armies to withdraw peacefully."
