      "text": "The infantry, as part of a volunteer and standing army, has an excellent moral that borders on fanaticism, is highly trained and very effective. Notably, there are cases of Fire Nation infantrymen known that fought huge monstrosities and spirits head-on without the chance of victory or survival, rather than surrendering, deserting or fleeing. Another example of the almost fanatical mindset of Fire Nation infantrymen was given during the Air Nomad Genocide; to kill a single airbending master, dozens of soldiers gave their lives without retreating. The nonbenders and firebenders fight together in joint companies, often operating with tanks or cavalry. Overall, the Fire Nation infantry is flexible, and due to their high moral and good training, commanders can entrust them with several different tasks."

The infamous helmets with faceplates were worn exclusively by firebenders, while nonbenders got only cone helmets. This separation ended under the reign of Fire Lord Zuko, and equipment was issued as needed and by competence. For example, nonbending guards got the infamous red and black armor and faceplates to scare off the Freedom Fighters during the Yu Dao-crisis in 101 AG. In addition to this, after the reforms of Fire Lord Zuko, the formerly vast Fire Nation Army became more compact, but also more effective.",

They took him to a local Fire Nation school, where he was escorted to a classroom taught by Ms. Kwan. They later assisted the Headmaster when he raided Aang's secret dance party after another student told him about it. The guards tried to catch Aang, but the other students put similar headbands on to confuse them and help Aang escape. Katara saved the local village of Jang Hui from the domestic forces whose nearby factory was polluting the river on which the village was situated. She did this by posing as the village's spiritual guardian, the Painted Lady. Later on, the authorities of Fire Fountain City attempted to apprehend Toph after she used her earthbending to scam the city's local con men and dealers. They managed to capture both Toph and Katara in an attempt to lure in Aang so that an assassin could eliminate him on behalf of Prince Zuko."
