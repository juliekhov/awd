Meanwhile, as the Fire Nation invades the city, Sokka, Katara, and Yue search for the prince and Aang. As Aang's returning spirit guides them to their location, they save him and return to the Spirit Oasis, though are too late to stop Admiral Zhao from slaying the Moon Spirit's mortal form, causing the moon to vanish and all waterbenders to lose their ability to bend. Enraged, Aang combines himself with the Ocean Spirit, La, and obliterate the entire Fire Nation armada. Meanwhile, Princess Yue, who was imbued with some of the energy of the Moon Spirit when she was a sickly newborn, sacrifices her life to restore it to life. As the moon returns in the sky, La releases Aang, though upon retreating to the oasis, ambushes Zhao, who refuses to allow Zuko to save him, and drags the admiral under the surface with him. After the battle's conclusion, Team Avatar journeys on, while Zuko decides to call off his pursuit of the Avatar for a while. Meanwhile, in the Fire Nation, a young woman receives an assignment from Fire Lord Ozai.",

Meanwhile, as the Fire Nation invades the city, Sokka, Katara, and Yue search for the prince and Aang. As Aang's returning spirit guides them to their location, they save him and return to the Spirit Oasis, though are too late to stop Admiral Zhao from slaying the Moon Spirit's mortal form, causing the moon to vanish and all waterbenders to lose their ability to bend. Enraged, Aang combines himself with the Ocean Spirit, La, and obliterate the entire Fire Nation armada. Meanwhile, Princess Yue, who was imbued with some of the energy of the Moon Spirit when she was a sickly newborn, sacrifices her life to restore it to life. As the moon returns in the sky, La releases Aang, though upon retreating to the oasis, ambushes Zhao, who refuses to allow Zuko to save him, and drags the admiral under the surface with him. After the battle's conclusion, Team Avatar journeys on, while Zuko decides to call off his pursuit of the Avatar for a while.
