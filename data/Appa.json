Appa did not know where he was going, only that he was leaving the air temples. Aang flew Appa over the ocean, at which point they were caught in a vicious storm which pushed the two underwater by stirring up the wind and the waves, and Aang lost consciousness. Faced with a life-or-death situation, the young Avatar entered the Avatar State and froze himself and Appa in an iceberg, where Appa was stuck in hibernation along with Aang for one hundred years until they were discovered by Katara and Sokka. After this, Appa became the group's main form of transportation in their quest to help Aang master all four elements."
