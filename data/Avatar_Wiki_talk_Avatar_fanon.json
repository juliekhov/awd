Why would I need it, when I list them in my Profile area. And there there is no thing specifically help in creating a \"character\" (other then titles) and so makes it difficult for me to consider making a character (because I don't know if I need a story first or not and also in fear of being deleted regardless of how much information and \"history\" details is on it). And why merge with the official? Wont that complicate things? I am pretty sure Fanon should be a separate wikia all together. This is what I feel really. I never had this much to think about (even on the Naruto fanon wikia). So, a good \"more detailed\" help (specifically character) if I can make one off the bat, or need a story (if I need a actual story to start it............. I don't know what to feel).
