Colonel Shinu has denied Zhao's request to use the group of advanced bowmen, whom he identifies as the ${link_7}, in the commander's quest to capture the ${link_8}, deeming it to be a \"vanity project\" of Zhao's rather than a part of the ${link_9}. As they debate the use of the archers, a hawk arrives with news from ${link_10} ${link_11} that Zhao has been promoted to ${link_12}. With his newfound authority, he informs Colonel Shinu that his request is now an order; Shinu bows in submission and leaves. Unbeknownst to Zhao, a figure clad in dark clothes and a blue mask is perched on the roof above him and has heard the entire conversation. Silently, the figure retreats into the shadows and disappears.",

In the courtyard, several highly proficient archers practice their skill, while, above them on a parapet of the stronghold, Commander Zhao and Colonel Shinu are observing them and vehemently arguing. Colonel Shinu has denied Zhao's request to use the group of advanced bowmen, whom he identifies as the Yuyan Archers, in the commander's quest to capture the Avatar, deeming it to be a \"vanity project\" of Zhao's rather than a part of the Hundred Year War. As they debate the use of the archers, a hawk arrives with news from Fire Lord Ozai that Zhao has been promoted to admiral. With his newfound authority, he informs Colonel Shinu that his request is now an order; Shinu bows in submission and leaves. Unbeknownst to Zhao, a figure clad in dark clothes and a blue mask is perched on the roof above him and has heard the entire conversation. Silently, the figure retreats into the shadows and disappears."

The Red Spirit's mask design and clothing were identical to those that Zuko wore in the show, although Zuko's Blue Spirit persona corresponds to what it was in The Last Airbender. Incidentally, Mike and Bryan got the idea of Zuko basing his Blue Spirit persona on a preexisting figure during a post-season two interview.\n In production, the creators dropped the Red Spirit idea because the initial design made Zuko look like \"an ancient Korean version of Spiderman\", and, as addressed by Anthony Lioi, made it appear as though he was associated with the Fire Nation, giving away his identity too easily."
