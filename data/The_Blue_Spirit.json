As they debate the use of the archers, a hawk arrives with news from ${link_10} ${link_11} that Zhao has been promoted to ${link_12}. With his newfound authority, he informs Colonel Shinu that his request is now an order; Shinu bows in submission and leaves. Unbeknownst to Zhao, a figure clad in dark clothes and a blue mask is perched on the roof above him and has heard the entire conversation. Silently, the figure retreats into the shadows and disappears.",

In the courtyard, several highly proficient archers practice their skill, while, above them on a parapet of the stronghold, Commander Zhao and Colonel Shinu are observing them and vehemently arguing. Colonel Shinu has denied Zhao's request to use the group of advanced bowmen, whom he identifies as the Yuyan Archers, in the commander's quest to capture the Avatar, deeming it to be a \"vanity project\" of Zhao's rather than a part of the Hundred Year War. As they debate the use of the archers, a hawk arrives with news from Fire Lord Ozai that Zhao has been promoted to admiral. With his newfound authority, he informs Colonel Shinu that his request is now an order; Shinu bows in submission and leaves. Unbeknownst to Zhao, a figure clad in dark clothes and a blue mask is perched on the roof above him and has heard the entire conversation. Silently, the figure retreats into the shadows and disappears."

As Aang's explanation starts to become panicked, she calmly tells him to settle down, noting that his friends would be just fine. She begins to tell him her life story: she has lived atop the mountain for forty years. The institute used to be a lively place, though now, she and her cat, Miyuki, were the only ones left. Despite Aang's nonplussed reaction, she continues to reveal that wounded Earth Kingdom soldiers still frequent the institute and it is due to her remedies that they are all able to recover quickly. Not really interested in what the herbalist has to say, Aang asks if she is almost finished with the concoction she was making and is told that it only needed one more ingredient. The elderly woman promptly starts to peruse her vast garden at a leisurely pace, causing him to grow impatient."

The masked figure, unsheathing his swords, points to the open gates and they make a run for them, but Zhao appears on the balcony, bellowing that the Avatar has escaped and orders all the gates to be closed immediately. Aang, running past the stranger and telling him to remain close to him, uses his airbending to clear away several guards blocking their path. Aang smoothly runs through the closing doors, though the masked figure is forced to stop and defend himself as several guards surround and assault him. Aang realizes that the stranger is no longer following him and takes the spear from a guard attacking him, breaks off the sharp spearhead, and utilizes the stick as a staff. He promptly charges the soldiers attacking the masked figure and uses his airbending to incapacitate them. Wasting no time, he hurls the stranger atop the first of the fortress walls, where more soldiers immediately swarm him.",

The figure defends them against all the spears thrown at them, but Aang is unable to sustain the twirling motion and they crash atop the next fortress wall, Aang losing his staff in the process. More guards come up to attack the duo, though they manage to dispose of them; the masked figure throws one of the soldiers over the wall, while Aang blows the others away with airbending. More troops use bamboo ladders to scale the wall, but again Aang blows them off. He takes the ladders and calls to the masked figure to get on his back. They use the three ladders like stilts to go from the second wall to the third and final wall. However, a soldier manages to light the last ladder on fire, forcing Aang and the masked figure to jump off in hopes that they will make it over the wall. However, their grip does not hold and they both fall to the ground just in front of the main gate.",
