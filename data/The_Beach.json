The boat pulls into the small port and the kids are greeted by Lo and Li. All of the teenagers, except for Ty Lee, express their disdain at their beach house. According to Mai, the pink seashell bedspread looked like \"the beach threw up all over [it].\" The sisters urge the kids to give Ember Island a chance, as the beach has a special way of smoothing even the most jagged of edges and revealing one's true self."
