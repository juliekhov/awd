It was comprised of five members and came to be chaired by Southern Water Tribe representative Sokka by 128 AG. The Council put Yakone on trial for the crimes he committed as a bloodbender and sentenced him to life in prison. After being sentenced, however, Yakone single-handedly bloodbent everyone in City Hall and escaped. Avatar Aang quickly caught up with him, however, and removed his bending."
