It depicts a teenage Aang dressed in traditional Air Nomad attire, with the accompanying necklace, which he had worn when Fire Lord Zuko announced the war's end at the latter's coronation. In the figure's left hand is a staff featuring the airbending symbol on its upper end. The figure's left foot rests on a slightly higher surface in the form of a lotus flower. The pedestal on which its other foot stands is octagonal in shape, with upturned tips at each vertex surrounded by railings. This leaves an opening at the back of the sculpture where a paifang gate connects the pedestal with a road linking the island to a dock."
