Her worry did not lessen while watching the fight, as Korra was being tossed around and barraged by earth- and metal-based attacks. Upon witnessing Korra fail to remain in the Avatar State, Jinora wondered what was troubling her friend, as they had gotten all the poison out of her system. When Kuvira exploited Korra's weakness and moved in to kill her, Jinora and Opal blew the army commander back with a powerful air blast. The intervention broke the peace treaty, however, and they were forced to create a large whirlwind to keep the incoming soldiers at bay. Jinora asked Opal to maintain the vortex while she used her astral projection ability to contact her siblings for help. As Meelo and Ikki arrived on Pepper, Jinora helped Opal to carry Korra on the bison's saddle and ordered her brother to take them out of there. In the air, Jinora and Ikki latched on to Opal to prevent her from diving down and help her family."
