She continued to meditate there until she was interrupted by a purple-mouthed, sickly looking Meelo and Poki. He offered her a bag filled with berries, which Jinora inspected and threw away after witnessing her brother and his pet throw up all the berries they had already consumed. Not having seen her sister in a while, she inquired if Meelo had encountered her on his foraging trip. When Meelo irritatedly commented that his mission was getting worse by the day as he now needed to find both the Avatar and Ikki, Jinora berated him for thinking about their quest as a solo mission, as they were supposed to find Korra as a family."

She was shocked to see the approach of an enormous mecha suit and after witnessing it destroy the United Forces' battleships with the spirit energy cannon it carried, she retreated toward the Future Industries factory where the hummingbird mecha suits were being assembled. Jinora was chosen by Korra to be part of a stealth team of airbenders tasked with the kidnapping of Baatar Jr.. While Korra, Tenzin, and Bumi infiltrated Kuvira's second-in-command's airship to apprehend him, she and Kai kept guard atop the vessel. They caught the sack containing a bound and gagged Baatar Jr. when the others airbent it out of the hatch and they all returned to the Future Industries factory. She was forced to run for her life, however, when Kuvira traced Baatar Jr.'s radio call toward the factory and blew it up with her spirit energy cannon."
