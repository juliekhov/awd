Kai got up alongside the truck and used his bending to jump in through the open window on the driver's side, but he was grabbed and held down by Ganbat.

Upon entering the Spirit World, however, they discovered that the once vibrant field of flowers that Republic City's spirit portal led to was now barren and seemingly burned down. Kai wondered who could be responsible for such a level of destruction and, as Jinora explained that only the spirits could have done that, did not understand why they would ravage their own environment. He was told by Korra that the spirits were using the destruction to send a message to the humans, which proved to be true moments later, as Kai found himself attacked by vines of the scorched spirit flowers, which ensnared his legs. He was saved by Jinora, who pulled him out of the vegetation's grasp, and the entire party rushed back through the portal. Before they could recover from their ordeal, however, they discovered that Raiko had ordered the United Forces to erect a perimeter around the portal, much to their dismay."

      "body": "While living by himself as an orphan, Kai sported a cunning and opportunistic attitude and he would deceive and use those around him to benefit himself. However, when he allows himself to get to know the people around him, he shows a more emphatic and compassionate side, as evidenced by how he appreciated Jinora training him in airbending, as well as how he protected Yung against the Dai Li. He is protective of those whom he holds dear and is willing to be merciless to ensure their safety, such as saving Jinora several times, assaulting Ganbat for attempting to kidnap Jinora and the baby bison, as well as to risk his own life, as evidenced when he attempted to distract P'Li in order to give the other airbenders a chance to escape. Overall, Kai is a mischievous, yet fun-loving, young boy who takes every opportunity for adventure, and is willing to sacrifice himself in order to save those whom he holds dear.",

He was able to use significant air blasts to knock Mako and Bolin onto the monorail, allowing him to escape, as well as directing specific gusts of air to facilitate his thefts. After training while held captive by the Dai Li, Kai displayed remarkably improved abilities in combative airbending, being able to knock out the Dai Li sergeant while rescuing Jinora in a single maneuver. During training with Tenzin, he was also the third one up the cliff and airbent to the top while the other recruits crawled. He completed the obstacle course relatively easily compared to the rest of the airbenders, showing his skill compared to the rest of the group. By the time the Red Lotus arrived, he could use a glider to fly and to attack at the same time. He is also capable of using a range of airbending techniques such as an air shield, which enabled him to survive a direct hit from P'Li's combustion blast. After three years of training, Kai improved significantly, being more proficient and precise in his airbending attack.",
