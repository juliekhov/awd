For example, sometimes a payment power's cost is not paid for in energies, but in the intercept value of the card. One must be careful when considering the use of this such payment power: if this power is paid for enough so that the intercept of the card is not high enough to withstand the force of an opponent card's attack, then that strike becomes unable to counterattack. Furthermore, a strike's intercept is not allowed to be lowered beyond zero through payment of the cost of payment powers."

This leads Player 2 into her yellow zone, where he or she flips another card. A strike card would continue the previously established format of the game, but let us say that she flips another advantage card, this time marked \"Immediate\". An immediate advantage is recognizable by boldface notice on the card and means that unlike normal advantage cards, it goes to the discard pile not when the turn is completed, but when its ability has been used. To put it another way, an immediate advantage would not be placed in the advantage area, but just used automatically. Like normal advantages, however, it must be paid for with energy before anything can be done with its ability."

The three traits in the sidebar are the character's basic traits. One of these basic traits corresponds to a trait of the strike demographic, one to the ally, and one to the advantage. The fourth trait in the corner is the special elemental trait, which designates which of the four elements the character bends. So, if this Chamber is used in a deck, then all strikes in the deck must share the same strike trait, all allies the same ally trait, all advantages the same advantage trait, and all elemental-trait cards the same element as the Chamber, or else have no trait at all.",
