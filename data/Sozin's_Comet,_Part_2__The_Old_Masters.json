In the dialogue, prince Arjuna prepares to engage in a major battle when he realizes that the opposing army is populated by many of his friends and relatives, and thus becomes conflicted about fighting, despite being aware of their evil. In order to convince Arjuna of the importance of taking part in battle, Lord Krishna, avatar of the god Vishnu, appears in the form of his charioteer and counsels the prince about his duties as a member of the warrior caste and as someone tasked with following the righteous path. The arguments that Krishna gives in favor of participating in the battle are very similar to the arguments that the Avatars give to Aang, like Kuruk's advice on the consequences of inaction and Kyoshi's alluding to a greater good that would outweigh the evil of taking life.",

      "text": "The scenes featuring Aang are very similar to the classic Hindu text Bhagavad Gita. In the dialogue, prince Arjuna prepares to engage in a major battle when he realizes that the opposing army is populated by many of his friends and relatives, and thus becomes conflicted about fighting, despite being aware of their evil. In order to convince Arjuna of the importance of taking part in battle, Lord Krishna, avatar of the god Vishnu, appears in the form of his charioteer and counsels the prince about his duties as a member of the warrior caste and as someone tasked with following the righteous path. The arguments that Krishna gives in favor of participating in the battle are very similar to the arguments that the Avatars give to Aang, like Kuruk's advice on the consequences of inaction and Kyoshi's alluding to a greater good that would outweigh the evil of taking life."
