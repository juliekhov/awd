Warrior weaponry included clubs, sharpened boomerangs, spears made of bone, scimitars, large shields and machetes lined with whale teeth on the dull side of the blade. Water Tribe warriors typically apply black and white war paint to their faces before going into battle. Hakoda's expeditionary force, however, used a special armor while on campaign. The armor consisted of helmets in the shape of a wolf's head and were outfitted with arm braces and greaves. The designs on their chests were different for each man. Possessing this full body armor and additional shields that could withstand small fire blasts, the Southern warriors were better equipped than the nonbending warriors of the Northern Tribe."

The tangle mines were constructed with a bamboo frame and covered with dried animal skin, while the inside was filled with skunk fish and seaweed. These mines floated in the water and would detonated when a ship hit them. When the mines detonated, they erupted seaweed, which tangled around the propeller of the ship, incapacitating it, and skunk fish, which terrible smell forced people to abandon ship. Though a very unusual type of mine, they had apparently been quite effective. Hakoda was also seen using small, handheld bombs. They appeared to be quite powerful, considering their size, only a few inches in diameter.",
