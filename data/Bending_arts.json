As the element of freedom, airbenders use their capability to bend unencumbered by the ground or any other environmental factors and use their own momentum as a weapon, evading attacks with astounding agility to tire their opponents out or building up massive inertia for explosive gusts of wind to make their counterattacks finishing moves. Airbenders, when resorting to physical confrontation, are able to harness the immense and intangible power of wind. Airbending's opposite is earthbending and the confrontational style that serves as its foundation. Airbenders can use a flight technique by operating a ${link_3} and using the air to provide thrust and lift. After the art was almost ${link_4} from existence, the only airbender left was Avatar ${link_5}, until his son, ${link_6}, and three grandchildren later inherited the ability. Airbending also resurfaced in a number of nonbenders following the ${link_7} of 171 AG, further reviving the almost extinct bending art. The sub-skills of airbending are flight and ${link_8}. Flight has only been achieved by two people in the entire history of airbending, namely Guru ${link_9} and ${link_10}. Airbending is the element of freedom, and its season is autumn.",

      "text": "Airbending is the bending art used by the Air Nomads; the flying bison were the original airbenders. It concentrates on speed and evasion, forgoing a strong offense for a greater defense. Though apparently lacking fatal finishing moves, it is the most dynamic of all the bending arts. As the element of freedom, airbenders use their capability to bend unencumbered by the ground or any other environmental factors and use their own momentum as a weapon, evading attacks with astounding agility to tire their opponents out or building up massive inertia for explosive gusts of wind to make their counterattacks finishing moves. Airbenders, when resorting to physical confrontation, are able to harness the immense and intangible power of wind. Airbending's opposite is earthbending and the confrontational style that serves as its foundation. Airbenders can use a flight technique by operating a glider and using the air to provide thrust and lift. After the art was almost wiped from existence, the only airbender left was Avatar Aang, until his son, Tenzin, and three grandchildren later inherited the ability. Airbending also resurfaced in a number of nonbenders following the Harmonic Convergence of 171 AG, further reviving the almost extinct bending art. The sub-skills of airbending are flight and spiritual projection. Flight has only been achieved by two people in the entire history of airbending, namely Guru Laghima and Zaheer. Airbending is the element of freedom, and its season is autumn."

It is a highly dangerous technique; if one's own energy is impure and therefore bendable, the practitioner will be consequently destroyed. Few Avatars have learned this bending art, and even fewer have used it. Energybending allows the user to remove other people's bending abilities, such as when Avatar Aang used it to strip Ozai and Yakone of their abilities, or restore them after a bender had their abilities blocked by bloodbending, demonstrated when Aang used it to restore Avatar Korra's bending from Amon's damage, and Korra used it to restore Lin Beifong's earthbending. Korra also used the art to create a spiritual projection of herself within the Tree of Time and battle the Dark Avatar."

      "body": "After the departure of the lion turtles, the acquisition of bending abilities became dependent on a large number of factors and complex variables; inheritance patterns are not well understood by the people of the World of Avatar. One important known factor in determining the likelihood of a person to inherit bending abilities is the genetic history of the family. It can be considered a recessive gene, since it is possible for a person to inherit bending skills even if they have two nonbending parents, as in the cases of Katara and Toph. Likewise, having one or two bending parents is no guarantee to inherit bending skills, as ${link_0} and ${link_1}, Aang and Katara's eldest son, were born a nonbender despite having two bending parents. People who have a greater genetic basis for bending are said to have more \"talent\", or inherent ability, than those who have a weaker genetic basis; however, genetics alone do not entirely account for the actual proficiency of a bender. While an individual with a strong family history in bending is most likely to become skilled in the art, a person with little genetic basis can also become a skilled bender through hard work, though it will require significantly more practice than someone with a good genetic history. On the other hand, it is also possible for someone with a strong genetic basis to go about their entire life without ever developing a true ability in bending, because of a poor spiritual upbringing or lack of fervor in practice. Due to these anomalies, the nature of bending acquisition fluctuates and has prevented the rise of a superior \"bending social class\" in the World of Avatar.",
