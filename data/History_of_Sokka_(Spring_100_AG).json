They watched a parade with giant floats that were made to look like Kyoshi, Roku and Aang. The trio at first believed that the festival was honoring the Avatar, but a man torched the three floats to the loud approval of the village, who chanted, \"Down with the Avatar! Down with the Avatar!\" Aang revealed himself as the Avatar, only to be arrested. While in his jail cell, the village's mayor explained to him that \"Avatar Day\" was formed after Avatar Kyoshi killed the village's leader, Chin the Great. Sokka took up the job as Aang's detective. To prove Aang's (or rather, Kyoshi's) innocence, Sokka and Katara searched the village and returned to Kyoshi Island to find evidence that said otherwise. The evidence was useless because in these trials, the opposing sides only told what they believe happened. Using only the two stories, the jury decided who was innocent and who was guilty; for this case, the village mayor served as both prosecution and jury."

While peeking through the window, enjoying the 'show', he was shoved from behind by an ostrich horse and winds up inside. While explaining the accident to the girls, he accidentally rhymed in haiku. The instructor became upset with the intrusion and disruption of the class. She was also severely annoyed by the unsophisticated meaning his haiku messages entailed and thus educated Sokka in the art of poetry by addressing him with a formal haiku. Sokka soon got into a contest with the teacher, (which seemed to parody a rap battle) both of whom spoke only in haiku."

Sokka and Toph soon saw General How, but before they could say anything, the Dai Li placed him under house arrest. At that very moment, every general was arrested. The two made it into the throne room and they revealed to the Earth King that the girls were not Kyoshi Warriors. Upon seeking Sokka, Ty Lee started to flirt with him, but he said that he was involved with Suki. Ty Lee did not know who Suki was, which exposed them, and Toph threw her to the side with earthbending. Mai, realizing that their identities were exposed, threw a hail of ornate shurikens at Toph, who blocked them with a wall of earth. Ty Lee began to \"fight\" Sokka. However, the fighting was in vain, as Azula soon had the king at flamepoint. Sokka and Toph gave up immediately and were soon disabled by Ty Lee. They were imprisoned by Dai Li agents, but were later able to escape with Toph using her metalbending skills to free them from their prison cell."
