He reaches outer space and, after shivering for a moment, makes a ball around himself and descends down very fast, leaving a trail as he does. Aang lands down on the ground with a confident expression, and grins. Appa gives him an \"8\" mark, Momo, a \"6\" mark, with Iroh waving his finger in an unimpressed manner.",
