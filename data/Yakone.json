When he made a threatening advance toward him, he was halted by his elder son, however, who quickly bloodbent him and threw Yakone's own words back at him, stating that it was he who was weak, because the Avatar had stripped him of his bending. The shocked and enraged Yakone reprimanded his son for using bloodbending against him and reminded him that he was the one who told them to use their abilities. Noatak countered that they were his sons not his \"tools of his revenge\", and, after failing to get Tarrlok to join him in running away, he flung his father into the snow and ran away on his own. Yakone and Tarrlok searched for Noatak for days, but they were unable to find him, leading them to conclude that he must have perished in the snowstorm. Thereafter, Yakone gave up on exacting his revenge against the Avatar, ceased teaching his remaining son any form of bending, and died a few years later."
