Early on, he was a member of The American Dream, a 1960s Philadelphia band whose debut album was Todd Rundgren's first production credit. More prominent success soon followed when he briefly became the unofficial fourth member of the British blues-rock band Foghat in the mid-1970s, producing several of their albums, including Fool for the City, which spawned the band's biggest hit, \"Slow Ride\". Jameson's bass-playing is prominently featured on this track as well as the rest of the album. He has also released a couple of solo albums, Already Free in 1977 and A Crowd of One in 1986, the latter of which featured an obscure single, \"Weatherman\", which peaked at #95 on the Hot 100. Another track from A Crowd of One, \"Love's Closing In\", was featured on the soundtrack of the 1986 film A Fine Mess.",
