While meditating in the Tree of Time, she is able to tap into the energy of the universe, creating a towering astral projection of herself. Using the spirit lights to travel to Republic City, she reignites her fight with Unalaq, who has besieged the city. After an intervention by Jinora's spirit, who brings Raava's residual light back into the world and reforms the light spirit within the Dark Avatar, Korra manages to extract Raava from him, before using his own spiritbending technique to dissipate the Dark Avatar. Korra returns to the Spirit World, where she uses the last of the energy from Harmonic Convergence to permanently merge with Raava once again, although the restoration of the Avatar Spirit fails to reconnect her with her past lives. Korra chooses to leave the spirit portals open, heralding the beginning of a new era in which spirits and mankind can coexist and move freely between the spirit and physical worlds.",

While meditating in the Tree of Time, she is able to tap into the energy of the universe, creating a towering astral projection of herself. Using the spirit lights to travel to Republic City, she reignites her fight with Unalaq, who has besieged the city. After an intervention by Jinora's spirit, who brings Raava's residual light back into the world and reforms the light spirit within the Dark Avatar, Korra manages to extract Raava from him, before using his own spiritbending technique to dissipate the Dark Avatar. Korra returns to the Spirit World, where she uses the last of the energy from Harmonic Convergence to permanently merge with Raava once again, although the restoration of the Avatar Spirit fails to reconnect her with her past lives.
