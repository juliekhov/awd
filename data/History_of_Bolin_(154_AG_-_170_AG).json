      "text": "Bolin joined his friends at the Southern Water Tribe as Korra was visiting Katara, who was attempting to restore her bending. After Katara failed to restore Korra's connection to water, earth, and fire, Bolin was visibly upset. Shortly after running away, Korra had an encounter with Avatar Aang's spirit, who restored her bending and transferred the knowledge of energybending to her. Bolin, along with everyone else, was astonished at Korra's new power."
