She harbored feelings for him as a younger child, blushing when she caught sight of him walking by.\u00a0When\u00a0Azula decided to make fun of their little crushes on each other, she invented a game that involved Azula putting an apple on Mai's head and lighting it on fire. When he saw the potential danger, Zuko ran to get the apple off Mai's head, and in doing so ended up knocking both of them into a fountain. After the Avatar was thought dead, the princess and Ty Lee arranged a date between the two when Zuko voiced reluctance to return to the Fire Nation. The couple quickly unfolded the ruse and set off to explore the city. When they ran into Jin, Mai decided to play along when Zuko told Jin she was a knife thrower at the circus where they performed. During an attempt to perform the same act, Jin nearly hit Zuko, causing him to fall into the fountain. She proceeded to lean over him with a smug smile and whisper, \"Now we're even.\" At the end of the date, the two reminisced their childhood and shared a kiss."
