In turn, Asami, angrily warned her not to threaten her or call her \"sweetheart\", provoking one of Jargala's companions to angrily question if Asami knew who Jargala was. Jargala ordered him to stop, as she understood that Asami did not want to offend her and instead continued persuading Asami to accept a small protection fee for herself and the construction from the Triple Threats. However, once more, Asami denied the agreement and showed the earthbender her ${link_2}. Unamused, Jargala asked Asami if she knew how to use that \"cute weapon\", to which she answered that she would be happy to give the Creeping Crystal a demonstration. Jargala said any demonstration would have to wait until later and began walking to the door, to the surprise of her partners. Upon the other members' questions, Jargala answered that Asami was not thinking straight, and it would be better to leave a couple of days that allow the nonbender to reconsider her offer.",

Upon Jargala's entry, Asami asked the triad member if she could help her, but Jargala, in fact, it was she who could help Asami, whom she addressed as sweetheart. Jargala seemed interested in Asami's construction project, adding that it would be a pity if she would not be able to finish it. In turn, Asami, angrily warned her not to threaten her or call her \"sweetheart\", provoking one of Jargala's companions to angrily question if Asami knew who Jargala was. Jargala ordered him to stop, as she understood that Asami did not want to offend her and instead continued persuading Asami to accept a small protection fee for herself and the construction from the Triple Threats. However, once more, Asami denied the agreement and showed the earthbender her electrified glove. Unamused, Jargala asked Asami if she knew how to use that \"cute weapon\", to which she answered that she would be happy to give the Creeping Crystal a demonstration. Jargala said any demonstration would have to wait until later and began walking to the door, to the surprise of her partners. Upon the other members' questions, Jargala answered that Asami was not thinking straight, and it would be better to leave a couple of days that allow the nonbender to reconsider her offer."
