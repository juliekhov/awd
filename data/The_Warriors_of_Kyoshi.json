As they begin to fly off, Katara tries to assure Aang that he did the right thing, as Zuko and his men would have burnt down the entire village if they had remained. Aang suddenly leaps down from Appa's back into the waters of the bay. A moment later, the unagi bursts out of the water with Aang clinging onto its whiskers. With some struggle, he manages to gain footing on the giant eel's head, directing it toward the burning village. The unagi spews a blast of water from its mouth, extinguishing the fires. Aang leaps into the air and is caught by Appa; the three promptly fly away into the sunset as the unagi swims underneath them.",
