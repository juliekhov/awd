He attempted to strike while Aang's back was turned, but Aang sensed his movement through seismic sense and quickly disabled him with earthen shackles. Aang remembered what the lion turtle taught him and used another type of bending, energybending, to remove Ozai's bending abilities. At first, Ozai's evil energy seemed to engulf Aang's pure energy, but when all seemed lost, Aang's energy completely engulfed Ozai's."
