She commented that he was probably thinking she could not take care of herself because she was blind and a little girl, as he would not let Toph pour her own cup of tea. Iroh explained that he poured her tea only because he wanted to and for no other reason. Toph told him that everyone treated her like she was helpless, but she could take care of herself. Iroh responded that she sounded like his nephew, mentioning how both seem to feel that they had to do everything themselves, but both had friends and family that love them and want to help them. He also added that he had been trying to track Zuko, so that even though Zuko may have wanted to be alone to figure out his problems at the moment, Iroh would be right there should Zuko need him. Iroh's words inspired Toph and she decided to go back and find her friends, but first told Iroh that Zuko was lucky to have an uncle like him and also that perhaps he should tell Zuko that the uncle needed the nephew as well. She proceeded to rejoin the Avatar's group in a fight against Azula, who finally disappeared with a firebending trick."

A massive hole had been ripped in the back of Toph's coffin, and she was not inside. Toph emerged further back on the road, and used earthbending to thrust Xin Fu and Yu back into the metal coffin. She quickly gripped each side of the hole she made earlier and pulled them back together, trapping her captors in her place, metalbending. After taking a few moments to yell out her triumph and state that she was the greatest earthbender ever, Toph rapidly headed back to Ba Sing Se by surfing along a self-made wave of earth. This left Xin Fu and Yu locked very uncomfortably within the coffin, and Xin Fu frustrated as ever at having to spend time with his companion while Yu needed to go to the bathroom.",
