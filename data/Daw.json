Despite orders from Lin Beifong to come down, Daw refused to budge out of fear that he would cause harm to other civilians. When metalbending officers ascended the beams of the bridge prepared to detain Daw, the man frantically conjured up an air blast that sent all of them plummeting into the harbor below. However, after consulting with Avatar Korra, Daw relented to develop his airbending under Tenzin's tutelage and agreed to come down. However, he missed a step while reaching toward Korra and fell from the beam, but was saved by Korra using her airbender staff. Following this, Korra introduced Daw to Tenzin, who expressed delight over meeting an airbender whose diaper he did not have to change. Daw corrected Tenzin and expressed his need to have a diaper change, as he had fallen off a bridge."
