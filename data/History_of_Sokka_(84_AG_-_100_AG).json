He explained how he knew this by telling about when he was wounded in battle and left in the abbey to heal by his fellow warriors, feeling the loneliest he had ever felt. This incident reminded Sokka of when Hakoda left to fight in the Hundred Year War, and he told Sokka that he could not come along and fight with him. Hakoda had told Sokka that being \"a man\" was about \"knowing where you're needed the most\", and that for Sokka, it was at the Southern Water Tribe, to protect his sister. Sokka and Katara realized their mistake and turned around to apologize and resume their journeys with Aang."

Hahn, however, was found to be a \"self-absorbed weasel\", according to Sokka, with a greater interest in rising in rank than Yue herself. The two got into a fight and Arnook pulled Sokka off the mission. A disgruntled Sokka was left behind until Arnook revealed the real reason behind the act: he wanted Sokka to protect Yue and be her bodyguard."
