After Hakoda greeted his children with a hug, Maliq excitedly shook Sokka's hand, telling him that he and his sister had been following the news about them for a long time, dating back to the saving of Tui and La during the Siege of the North. At the end of the conversation among Malina and Katara, Sokka, and Hakoda, Maliq offered to take them to dinner, and Sokka enthusiastically accepted."
