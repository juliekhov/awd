As she pleads for their patience, considering ${link_11} only transpired a few weeks prior, Raiko promptly seizes the opportunity to deflect the blame for the vine problem onto her. Angered by the accusation, Korra shoots back angrily that she saved the world, something that his administration was woefully unable to do. Before the conflict between the two can derail, ${link_12} separates them and ends the conference; a peeved Raiko returns to his office while the press dissipates. As Korra muses to herself that the situation was a disaster, ${link_13} walks up to her, trying to console the deeply disappointed ${link_14} by pointing out that they will work something out. Korra brushes her off, sulking over the fact that she only holds an 8% approval rating among the city's population. Although Asami assures her that the city's people are simply frustrated, she agrees with them, reasoning that she, as the Avatar, should be able to fix their situation.",

With no choice, Korra flies away from Tenzin and Jinora on her glider, arriving moments later at a press conference being held by President Raiko at City Hall, where he is being peppered with questions about his approval ratings and the vine infestation pestering the city. The moment she touches down, the assembled reporters bombard her with questions about how she handled the Unalaq Crisis and intents to deal with the vines and spirits uprooting the city life. As she pleads for their patience, considering Harmonic Convergence only transpired a few weeks prior, Raiko promptly seizes the opportunity to deflect the blame for the vine problem onto her. Angered by the accusation, Korra shoots back angrily that she saved the world, something that his administration was woefully unable to do. Before the conflict between the two can derail, Lin Beifong separates them and ends the conference; a peeved Raiko returns to his office while the press dissipates. As Korra muses to herself that the situation was a disaster, Asami walks up to her, trying to console the deeply disappointed Avatar by pointing out that they will work something out. Korra brushes her off, sulking over the fact that she only holds an 8% approval rating among the city's population. Although Asami assures her that the city's people are simply frustrated, she agrees with them, reasoning that she, as the Avatar, should be able to fix their situation."

When Raiko arrives, Korra tells him that every denizen of Republic City will have to learn to live with the changes the Spirit Wilds have made to the city, as both the vines and the spirits are there to stay. Irritated, Raiko retaliates by demanding that Korra leaves the city, stating she has caused nothing but trouble since she arrived. Angrily complying with the order, she approaches Tenzin and promises to help find the new airbenders and rebuild the Air Nation."
