With no choice, Korra flies away from Tenzin and Jinora on her ${link_5}, arriving moments later at a press conference being held by ${link_6} ${link_7} at ${link_8}, where he is being peppered with questions about his approval ratings and the vine infestation pestering the city. The moment she touches down, the assembled ${link_9} bombard her with questions about how she handled the ${link_10} and intents to deal with the vines and spirits uprooting the city life. As she pleads for their patience, considering ${link_11} only transpired a few weeks prior, Raiko promptly seizes the opportunity to deflect the blame for the vine problem onto her. Angered by the accusation, Korra shoots back angrily that she saved the world, something that his administration was woefully unable to do. Before the conflict between the two can derail, ${link_12} separates them and ends the conference; a peeved Raiko returns to his office while the press dissipates. As Korra muses to herself that the situation was a disaster, ${link_13} walks up to her, trying to console the deeply disappointed ${link_14} by pointing out that they will work something out. Korra brushes her off, sulking over the fact that she only holds an 8% approval rating among the city's population. Although Asami assures her that the city's people are simply frustrated, she agrees with them, reasoning that she, as the Avatar, should be able to fix their situation.",

With no choice, Korra flies away from Tenzin and Jinora on her glider, arriving moments later at a press conference being held by President Raiko at City Hall, where he is being peppered with questions about his approval ratings and the vine infestation pestering the city. The moment she touches down, the assembled reporters bombard her with questions about how she handled the Unalaq Crisis and intents to deal with the vines and spirits uprooting the city life. As she pleads for their patience, considering Harmonic Convergence only transpired a few weeks prior, Raiko promptly seizes the opportunity to deflect the blame for the vine problem onto her. Angered by the accusation, Korra shoots back angrily that she saved the world, something that his administration was woefully unable to do. Before the conflict between the two can derail, Lin Beifong separates them and ends the conference; a peeved Raiko returns to his office while the press dissipates. As Korra muses to herself that the situation was a disaster, Asami walks up to her, trying to console the deeply disappointed Avatar by pointing out that they will work something out. Korra brushes her off, sulking over the fact that she only holds an 8% approval rating among the city's population. Although Asami assures her that the city's people are simply frustrated, she agrees with them, reasoning that she, as the Avatar, should be able to fix their situation."

Zaheer announces that like all great children's tales, there is truth within the myth, reciting a poem of Laghima's: \"Instinct is a lie, told by a fearful body hoping to be wrong.\" When the guard asks what it means, Zaheer explains that it means that if one were to base their expectations only on what they could see, they would blind themselves to the possibilities of the new. He backs up the saying by airbending the sentry against the door of his cell, enabling him to hold the shocked guard down, using him as a shield against the other sentries. Upon being asked how he did that, Zaheer states that nature is constantly changing like the wind. Stealing the guard's keys and freeing himself, he uses his bending abilities to incapacitate and subsequently imprison the other guards inside his cell.

      "text": "At a prison located atop a mountain somewhere, White Lotus sentries bring food to Zaheer. He asks if they have ever heard of Guru Laghima, an Air Nomad who lived at the Northern Air Temple and unlocked the secret of weightlessness, allowing himself to become untethered from the earth and live the last forty years of his life without touching the ground. Mocking the tale, dismissing it as an \"old airbender children's story\", one of the sentries asks if he plans to escape using that technique. Zaheer announces that like all great children's tales, there is truth within the myth, reciting a poem of Laghima's: \"Instinct is a lie, told by a fearful body hoping to be wrong.\" When the guard asks what it means, Zaheer explains that it means that if one were to base their expectations only on what they could see, they would blind themselves to the possibilities of the new. He backs up the saying by airbending the sentry against the door of his cell, enabling him to hold the shocked guard down, using him as a shield against the other sentries. Upon being asked how he did that, Zaheer states that nature is constantly changing like the wind. Stealing the guard's keys and freeing himself, he uses his bending abilities to incapacitate and subsequently imprison the other guards inside his cell. Before he leaves, he declares the dawn of a new age, one that will see the end of the Order of the White Lotus and the Avatar."
