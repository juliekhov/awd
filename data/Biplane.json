Asami used one of these planes to pilot Bolin and Mako close enough to the Northern encampment at the Southern spirit portal to enable them to attack the Northern soldiers stationed there. However, the plane was eventually brought down by Desna and Eska, who used their waterbending to sever the plane's tail."
