Tarrlok offers to release Korra's friends if she heeds his demands in the future. Korra refuses and declares the councilman to be \"just as bad as Amon\". Outraged, Tarrlok lashes out at Korra, forcing her back against the wall away from him with his waterbending. To shield herself against the razor sharp icicles, Korra creates a wall of earth and manages to gain the upper hand by earthbending the fountain wall against Tarrlok, pushing him out of the room and down into the main room of City Hall."
