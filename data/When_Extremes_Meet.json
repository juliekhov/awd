      "text": "That night, Korra rides Naga to City Hall, where she confronts Tarrlok, saying that his actions are exactly what Amon claims is wrong with benders, namely using his power to oppress and intimidate people. Tarrlok retaliates by pointing out that she is doing the same thing by trying to intimidate him to make him release her friends, claiming they are similar in their determination to gain what they want, though Korra instantly refutes the idea. Tarrlok offers to release Korra's friends if she heeds his demands in the future. Korra refuses and declares the councilman to be \"just as bad as Amon\". Outraged, Tarrlok lashes out at Korra, forcing her back against the wall away from him with his waterbending. To shield herself against the razor sharp icicles, Korra creates a wall of earth and manages to gain the upper hand by earthbending the fountain wall against Tarrlok, pushing him out of the room and down into the main room of City Hall."
