Ursa berated him while the creature approached Zuko and bit his ankle though was returned to the water by Ursa. Searching the reason why the turtle duck had bitten him, Ursa told Zuko that mothers were protective of their children and would \"bite back\" when they were in danger, proceeding to bite her son in a caring way. As Ursa and Zuko were walking through a courtyard, both were approached by Azula, who persuaded her mother to let Zuko play with her, Mai, and Ty Lee.

She asked him if Aang, Katara, and Sokka had left. After Zuko said yes, she said he was lucky to have \"such good friends\". Once again, Zuko asked if she was okay and she replied she just needed fresh air. Zuko thought she was upset about Kiyi, though Ursa admitted that she was thinking about Azula and asked her son if he thought she was safe, warm, and happy. Zuko recalled how he spent weeks looking for her in Forgetful Valley without finding her, which meant Azula did not want to be found. He believed her to be safe as he knew she would survive, though he did not know what \"happy\" was for Azula. Ursa told her son they should not be dour right before returning to the capital and that it would be wonderful to see him in his element. As Zuko took her hand to thank her, he found it\u00a0was cold and began to take her below deck. However, a messenger hawk carrying a message from the Kyoshi warriors appeared, and after seeing her son's angered face, Ursa asked if something was wrong but was assured that it was nothing he could not handle. Before she went below the deck, Zuko promised to keep her family, especially Kiyi, safe with all his power."
