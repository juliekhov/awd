While Korra initially hesitated making a decision, Asami told Keum that the Spirit World was sacred, and people like him should not be allowed to enter it. At the same time, the dragon eel spirit, who previously refused Korra's request to fight Kuvira, asked the Avatar to close the portal to keep the likes of Keum from exploiting it. Korra refused, stating her belief that keeping the portal open would ensure harmony between humans and spirits; the spirit said he could not force her to close the portal, but that he would hold her responsible for the portal's safety. When the spirit left, Keum tried to order everyone off his property, but Korra went into the Avatar State and demanding he leave, effectively scaring Keum away from the cite.

While Korra initially hesitated making a decision, Asami told Keum that the Spirit World was sacred, and people like him should not be allowed to enter it.

When Korra asked about this, Asami revealed that last night she had been visited by Jargala Omo and the Creeping Crystal Triad, who had attempted to extort her. Furious, Korra offered to go and intimidate Jargala into leaving Asami alone, but Asami urged her to let her handle the situation herself. When Korra insisted that she wanted to help Asami, her girlfriend replied that she did not need it, prompting Korra to turn away with a cold look. Recognizing her girlfriend's anger at her perceived ingratitude, Asami clarified that she simply did not want Korra to have to act as the Avatar every time she had a problem; Korra replied that she was not protective because she was the Avatar, but because she cared about Asami more than anyone and could not bear the thought of anything happening to her. Asami assured her that nothing would happen, and the couple embraced each other."

Against other firebenders, she can easily deflect and disperse the enemies' attack. Her control is so fine, she is able to produce a small yet intense flame at her fingers that she can maintain to melt through metal chains. She can likewise produce daggers in each hand for close-range combat. She can propel herself through the air with firebending in short bursts, and use these bursts to run along a wall. Contrary to the usual difficulty an Avatar has with learning the opposite of his/her native element, firebending has become second nature to her. Korra tends to utilize firebending when provoked, frustrated, or attempting to assert dominance, such as when she falls back on firebending a newspaper cut out of Lin after failing to do so with airbending. Tenzin attributed this unusual combination to her innate personality being quite fit for the art thanks to her natural assertiveness and fiery spirit.",

Six months after the Anti-bending Revolution, she has nearly mastered the art, employing traditional maneuvers, such as gliding, and is able to proficiently use several advanced skills, such as the air scooter.
