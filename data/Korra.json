With the assistance of Aang's spirit, Korra gained the ability to energybend, and after connecting with her past lives, she gained the capacity to enter the Avatar State at will, marking her transition into a fully realized Avatar. However, due to her temporary separation from Raava during the Harmonic Convergence of 171 AG, she no longer has a connection to her past lives. After defeating Kuvira and bringing an end to the Earth Empire, Korra started a romantic relationship with her best friend, Asami Sato."

However, after Tenzin's move to her home fell through, Korra took matters into her own hands and stowed away on a ship, traveling to Republic City. Roaming though the city in search of Air Temple Island, she discovered that the bustling metropolis was not all that she was told to be; she learned that there was a great deal of imbalance among its citizens with triads and Equalists running around. After defeating some members of the Triple Threat Triad, she found herself in trouble with Lin Beifong and her Metalbending Police Force. She was cleared of all charges due to Tenzin's intervention and eventually allowed to stay with him at the air temple to commence her airbending training there. However, progress was slow and the Avatar grew frustrated. To unwind, she joined the Fire Ferrets pro-bending team and befriended her teammates, the brothers Mako and Bolin."

They journeyed to Ba Sing Se, where they eventually discovered that Earth Queen Hou-Ting had been conscripting the airbenders into her army, holding them captive underneath the Earth Queen's Temple. Before they could formulate a plan to free them, Lin joined them and informed them of the escape of four dangerous criminals who were after Korra. She dismissed the threat, however, and decided to stay focused on freeing the airbenders. Successfully fighting off the Dai Li and escaping the city, the airbenders and Tenzin traveled to the Northern Air Temple, while Korra, her friends, and Lin continued the search for more benders."

As Tenzin tried to put her at ease by pointing out that there was no shame in taking the time needed to make a full recovery as her duties as the Avatar could wait, Korra asked about the Earth Kingdom, since she knew it was still in chaos. Hearing that the situation had been stabilized by Kuvira, she grew sad, stating that the metalbender was doing her job. Before Tenzin could tell her that she merely needed to be patient, Korra glared at him, threatening that if he would voice the thought, she would \"water-smack\" him in the mouth. Frustrated about the situation, she left the sparring ring."
