He was swiftly able to subdue Unalaq's four guards, and the two brothers collided in a fierce water duel. Tonraq eventually managed to get within striking distance of Unalaq, but before he could land his blow, Unalaq struck his unprotected stomach with an ice pillar. Trapped in a block of ice, Tonraq received a devastating blow which left him defeated."
