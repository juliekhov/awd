While the others are optimistic about having reached the city, Toph is none too thrilled: apparently, she did not find the thought of \"life in the big city\" much to her liking. Soon after they arrive, Aang and his friends are met by ${link_9}, a woman assigned to guide them around the city. Attempts by Sokka to try to get their guide to talk about the War and a possible audience with the ${link_10} are invariably ignored. As they see the many sections of Ba Sing Se, Team Avatar soon finds the segregation of rich and poor people is not to their liking. Aang recalls that this was the reason that he did not visit the city in the years before his being trapped in the iceberg, as the ${link_11} taught equality for all. When a possible audience with the Earth King is finally mentioned, it is revealed that they will have to wait at least a month. It soon becomes apparent that within the walls of the city, no one wants to talk or even think about the War raging in the rest of the world. Even Aang's attempts to find ${link_12} bear no fruit as no one seems willing to divulge any information to them, thanks to some meaningful glances from Joo Dee. A ${link_13}, however, reveals that conversing about the War is strictly forbidden and warns the team to steer clear of the secret police force, the ${link_14}.",

While the others are optimistic about having reached the city, Toph is none too thrilled: apparently, she did not find the thought of \"life in the big city\" much to her liking. Soon after they arrive, Aang and his friends are met by Joo Dee, a woman assigned to guide them around the city. Attempts by Sokka to try to get their guide to talk about the War and a possible audience with the Earth King are invariably ignored. As they see the many sections of Ba Sing Se, Team Avatar soon finds the segregation of rich and poor people is not to their liking. Aang recalls that this was the reason that he did not visit the city in the years before his being trapped in the iceberg, as the Air Nomads taught equality for all. When a possible audience with the Earth King is finally mentioned, it is revealed that they will have to wait at least a month. It soon becomes apparent that within the walls of the city, no one wants to talk or even think about the War raging in the rest of the world. Even Aang's attempts to find Appa bear no fruit as no one seems willing to divulge any information to them, thanks to some meaningful glances from Joo Dee. A neighbor, however, reveals that conversing about the War is strictly forbidden and warns the team to steer clear of the secret police force, the Dai Li."
