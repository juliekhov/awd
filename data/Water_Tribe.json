The warriors had apparently achieved this so far with the use of tangle mines, which are buoyant, terrible smelling makeshift mines of ${link_1}'s invention, and which he affectionately nicknames, the \"stink n' sink\". The tangle mines are constructed with a bamboo frame and covered with dried animal skin, while the inside is filled with skunk fish and seaweed. These mines float in the water and detonate when a ship hits them. When the mines detonate, they erupt seaweed, which tangles around the propeller of the ship, incapacitating it, while the terrible smell of the skunk fish forces people to abandon ship.

The warriors had apparently achieved this so far with the use of tangle mines, which are buoyant, terrible smelling makeshift mines of Hakoda's invention, and which he affectionately nicknames, the \"stink n' sink\". The tangle mines are constructed with a bamboo frame and covered with dried animal skin, while the inside is filled with skunk fish and seaweed.
