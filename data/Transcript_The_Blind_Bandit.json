Cut to a shot of her feet as she moves forward to finish the set up for her attack. The Boulder moves forward at a slow frame rate. He is bellowing a slurred battle cry. Cut to a wider shot of The Boulder as his foot strikes the ground again, the screen flashes black and white again as another shock wave is shown moving out from him. Cut back to a frontal shot of the Bandit who has begun to swing her right foot in an arc toward the ground in font of her. As she strikes the ground, the view cuts to a wide shot from behind and above on her right. The frame rate speeds up to normal. Her strike creates a shock wave in the arena floor that churns up the ground in the direction of the Boulder in a straight line.",

Cut briefly to Momo and Sokka. Momo squeaks and Sokka's look of adulation and excitement turns to a look of pain. Cut to a close shot from above The Boulder.
