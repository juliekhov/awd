Lian retreated to a large room, where she had her Ultimation, a large, weaponized machine that could \"bend\" all four elements, stand at the ready. Confronted by the group, she revealed that she was making the machines to eliminate benders, holding them responsible for the war, and that her latest creation, the Ultimation, was powered by three benders: Haru's friend, Yuan; a Fire Nation soldier; and Hiryu, a waterbender from the North Pole. She had threatened to kill them along with the other\u00a0benders if they did not agree to\u00a0help her.\u00a0She made Aang the same offer again, telling him that they could end the war together and that she could help him become a fully-realized Avatar. Enraged when he once again declined her offer, she declared her machine to be a better Avatar than he would ever be, and that she did not need a mindless bender like him. During the ensuing battle, Lian and Team Avatar traded blows, both managing to get in a few hits. When Lian succeeded in hurting Katara, she inadvertently triggered the Avatar Sate, which Aang used to defeat Ultimation; the machine toppled over."
