Under the impression that the vessel was part of the Western Fleet, the officer boarded the ship with two of his soldiers, where he asked Hakoda and Bato, both disguised as Fire Nation officers, why they were not en route toward Ba Sing Se to join the rest of the Western Fleet to support the occupation of the Earth Kingdom capital. Being told that the ship was part of the Eastern Fleet with orders to deliver some cargo, he grew annoyed about the lack of communication from Admiral Chan to alert him that an Easter Fleet ship would come their way. The disguised Water Tribe men assured the officer that they would send two messenger hawks in the future, and the Fire Navy officer moved to return to his own ship."
