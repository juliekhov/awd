One chi blocker threw a ${link_4}, but Korra intercepted and froze it, trapping the gas inside. She pursued the last two fleeing chi blockers and tripped on a wire just as an Equalist jumped down from above. She stopped him by kicking a rock into his chest, but when another one was about to ensnare her, Tarrlok froze him against the wall just in time. The flawless raid made the front page of the newspaper as Tarrlok called a press conference together and showcased the arrest of several Equalists to the journalists.",

Led by the Councilman, the group first flooded the camp and froze four Equalists, followed by earthbending attacks that broke through the wall, allowing the benders to storm in and quickly subdue the majority of the other chi blockers. One chi blocker threw a smoke grenade, but Korra intercepted and froze it, trapping the gas inside. She pursued the last two fleeing chi blockers and tripped on a wire just as an Equalist jumped down from above. She stopped him by kicking a rock into his chest, but when another one was about to ensnare her, Tarrlok froze him against the wall just in time. The flawless raid made the front page of the newspaper as Tarrlok called a press conference together and showcased the arrest of several Equalists to the journalists."
