When the boy was kidnapped by the Fire Nation, Sokka figured that they were looking for someone old, but soon realized that the boy was who they wanted. As Katara pleaded with Sokka to help her save the boy, the bison creature floated in the air as if wanting to follow his master, but was held back out of concern of the children hanging dangerously off his feet. Sokka thought of a plan to use the flying bison to rescue the boy.",

In the resulting ice crater, Katara and Sokka discovered a thirteen-year-old boy, alive but exhausted, with his large six-legged bison creature. When the boy was kidnapped by the Fire Nation, Sokka figured that they were looking for someone old, but soon realized that the boy was who they wanted. As Katara pleaded with Sokka to help her save the boy, the bison creature floated in the air as if wanting to follow his master, but was held back out of concern of the children hanging dangerously off his feet. Sokka thought of a plan to use the flying bison to rescue the boy."
