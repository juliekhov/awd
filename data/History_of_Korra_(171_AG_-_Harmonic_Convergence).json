As she dispersed the dark entities, she consequently cleaned their hold on the ancient site in the process, restoring it to its former glory. When Tenzin walked up to her and bitterly noted how much more effective Unalaq's teachings had been for her spiritual training than his own, Korra immediately put him at ease by emphasizing that he had trained her in order to help her, as opposed to doing it for personal gain. She proceeded to apologize for how she had treated him, expressing her regret over turning her back on him. When she stated that she needed him more than ever, Tenzin promptly stated that he would not let her down, and the two shared a hug."
