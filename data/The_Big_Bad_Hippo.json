The Hippo proceeded to lift Aang's metal cage onto his shoulder in order to leave the arena and collect the bounty from the Fire Nation for capturing the Avatar. However, Toph challenged him and the other fighters, promising to beat them all again in an earthbending battle if they refused to release Aang. Engaging in a battle with all the wrestlers at once, Toph succeeded in taking every one of them out. The Boulder, The Hippo, and the Headhunter were the last fighters remaining. The Hippo defended himself by swinging around a large, earthen model of the Earth Kingdom's national emblem. Tag teaming with the other two, The Hippo charged the blind earthbending girl. However, by shifting the earth they all stood on, Toph was able to defeat them easily."
