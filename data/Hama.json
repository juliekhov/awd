For years, Hama was one of many waterbenders residing in the Southern Water Tribe; however, when she was a young adult, the Fire Nation began raiding the Southern Water Tribe, and systematically weakened its defenses by capturing waterbenders through hit-and-run attacks. Hama and her fellow waterbenders did everything they could to resist the ${link_3} army, and they even managed to freeze at least one ${link_4} by suspending it on ice. However, as the raids continued, more and more waterbenders were captured, until Hama was the last waterbender standing in the Southern Tribe.

For years, Hama was one of many waterbenders residing in the Southern Water Tribe; however, when she was a young adult, the Fire Nation began raiding the Southern Water Tribe, and systematically weakened its defenses by capturing waterbenders through hit-and-run attacks. Hama and her fellow waterbenders did everything they could to resist the firebending army, and they even managed to freeze at least one ship by suspending it on ice. However, as the raids continued, more and more waterbenders were captured, until Hama was the last waterbender standing in the Southern Tribe. She eventually surrendered and was led away in chains to be transported back to the Fire Nation to be imprisoned."

However, each month Hama could feel the power of the full moon and knew there had to be a way to escape. She eventually realized that because water exists within all living things, she could control them by bending the water inside their bodies, and escape. Only during full moons, when her bending is at its greatest peak, could Hama manipulate the water in the bodies of the ${link_0} in her cell, and after many years of practice, she mastered this ability, which she named bloodbending. On the next full moon, Hama used bloodbending to control one of the prison guards and force him to unlock her cage, allowing her to escape her imprisonment, freed by one of the guards assigned to keep her locked in.",
