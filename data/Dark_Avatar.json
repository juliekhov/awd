Using cosmic energy, Korra was able to overwhelm the Dark Avatar and attempted to extract light from within Unalaq, to no avail. This setback allowed the Dark Avatar to subdue Korra with a dark variation of spiritbending and corrupt her soul, until Jinora's spirit appeared to intervene. The young airbender, whose own spiritual powers were augmented by the Convergence, released a beam of light, allowing Korra to find Raava within the Dark Avatar and subsequently remove her, before cleansing Vaatu using her uncle's own purification technique, destroying the Dark Avatar in the process."
