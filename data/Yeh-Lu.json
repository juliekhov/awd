Aang and the Water Tribe siblings helped defend of the village. During the fight, Sokka distracted Vachir by reflecting sunlight in his magnifying glass. The archer blindly shot a burning arrow in Sokka's direction. The arrow missed the Water Tribe warrior, and instead embedded itself in the saddle bag attached to Yeh-Lu's rhino. Sokka ducked for cover as the bag, containing five sticks of dynamite, caught fire. Yeh-Lu immediately saw the danger and tried to save himself by throwing the bag on the roof of a neighboring house. However, the house collapsed under the thunderous explosion; the force of the explosion slammed Yeh-Lu and his mount against a wall. As Sokka looked up again, Yeh-Lu's helmet rolled by and a bag containing Sokka's boomerang landed next to him."
