Viper led the Triple Threat Triad in this chaos but soon found his position as leader challenged on multiple occasions. Eventually, Tokuga took the fight to him, and Viper lost the battle for the Triple Threat Triad throne. He later took part in a turf war against the Creeping Crystal Triad. Before the battle could be decided, the Republic City Police intervened, forcing Viper and the others on the run. He did not get very far, however, and was arrested by Lin. When he later got out of prison, Viper was eventually murdered by Tokuga."
