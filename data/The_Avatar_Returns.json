Because of the mishap, the safety of the village has been compromised. A bitter argument ensues, in which Sokka decides to banish Aang from the Southern Water Tribe for his perceived betrayal, an action Kanna agrees with. Katara, outraged by the decision, initially resolves to leave with Aang, who had offered to take her to the Northern Water Tribe to find a master waterbender who could teach her. However, Sokka asks her if she would actually choose Aang over her own family. As Aang states that he does not want to come between Katara and her family, she rethinks her decision and sadly decides to stay. A downcast Aang and Appa depart from the village, setting course for the Southern Air Temple, where Aang previously lived. Katara, frustrated that they have banished Aang, snaps angrily at her grandmother, leaving Kanna looking saddened."

Unable to compensate for the extra weight nor break free of Zuko's grip, Aang and Zuko fall to the deck below. The two prepare to face off a third time, but are distracted by the sudden appearance of Appa, who is carrying Sokka and Katara; Zuko is stunned briefly as he looks at the large flying animal. Aang's enthusiasm is brief as Zuko attacks him almost immediately; airbending with his staff, the Avatar accidentally lifts himself into the air and the force of Zuko's next several fire blasts presses him to the edge of the deck, knocking his staff away. Another two blasts follow and Aang is thrown, unharmed by the flames but nonetheless unconscious, over the side of the ship into the frigid ocean.",
