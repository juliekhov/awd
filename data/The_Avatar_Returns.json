Because of the mishap, the safety of the village has been compromised. A bitter argument ensues, in which Sokka decides to banish Aang from the Southern Water Tribe for his perceived betrayal, an action Kanna agrees with. Katara, outraged by the decision, initially resolves to leave with Aang, who had offered to take her to the Northern Water Tribe to find a master waterbender who could teach her. However, Sokka asks her if she would actually choose Aang over her own family. As Aang states that he does not want to come between Katara and her family, she rethinks her decision and sadly decides to stay. A downcast Aang and Appa depart from the village, setting course for the Southern Air Temple, where Aang previously lived. Katara, frustrated that they have banished Aang, snaps angrily at her grandmother, leaving Kanna looking saddened."

In the Avatar State, Aang waterbends the sea around him, rising out of the ocean on a towering, whirling column of water. Zuko, Katara, and Sokka are shocked by this immense display of bending power; as they stare, Aang quickly lowers himself to the deck of the ship, bending his liquid platform into a spinning wall of water that washes Zuko and all of the guards on deck away, Zuko himself tumbling overboard. Appa lands on the deck while Aang, apparently dazed after the massive display of power, collapses."

In the same manner in which Zuko defeated him, Sokka jabs the prince in the forehead with the end of the staff thrice, stunning him enough to send him overboard again. However, Zuko is able to grasp the anchor chain, preventing himself from falling back into the water. Some of the soldiers recover and begin to approach Katara and the still-exhausted Aang. Katara, although inexperienced at waterbending, is able to freeze the guards in place to stop their approach. All three take off on Appa just as Iroh arrives on the scene. Iroh helps Zuko on board, and the two launch a combined fire blast in an attempt to shoot down the escaping ${link_0}. Aang recovers from his dazed state just in time to defend against the attack, using a blast of wind to deflect the fireball into one of the massive walls of ice on either side of the ship. The resulting avalanche of ice collapses onto the front half of Zuko's ship, immobilizing it. As Appa flies into the distance, his liberated passengers laugh happily.",
