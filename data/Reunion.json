Korra apologizes for not staying in touch and changes the subject, asking Asami and Mako what has been going on with them. Asami tells them that she has visited her father in prison for the first time, as he had been writing her letters and she finally felt ready to try and forgive him. When Korra wonders aloud if she can trust Hiroshi, fearing that he might try to manipulate Asami again, Asami snaps back that she knows what her own father is capable of and that Korra, having vanished for three years, has no right to act like she knows what is best for Asami. Feeling conscious about her absence, Korra says that she never planned to be gone for three years; it was just something she needed to do in order to heal.",

He is put out by Korra's immediate refusal, and Asami takes control of the situation by asking Korra if she can enter the Avatar State again, telling her she was worried when Korra told to her she could not. Before Korra can answer, Mako, suddenly suspicious, asks how Asami knew that. The two women share a look, and Korra confesses that she wrote letters to Asami while she was absent and asked her not to tell Mako and Bolin, a revelation that deeply frustrates the firebender. Korra apologizes for not staying in touch and changes the subject, asking Asami and Mako what has been going on with them. Asami tells them that she has visited her father in prison for the first time, as he had been writing her letters and she finally felt ready to try and forgive him. When Korra wonders aloud if she can trust Hiroshi, fearing that he might try to manipulate Asami again, Asami snaps back that she knows what her own father is capable of and that Korra, having vanished for three years, has no right to act like she knows what is best for Asami. Feeling conscious about her absence, Korra says that she never planned to be gone for three years; it was just something she needed to do in order to heal."

Irked, Korra yells at him for not keeping a proper watch on Wu, as was his job, unaware that Kuvira's agents have overheard them. As Mako and Korra make their way into the baggage car, they find Wu stuffed into a suitcase, but two of Kuvira's agents attack them. Korra deflects their metalbending attacks before airbending them into the roof of the car; as two more agents approach from opposite ends of the train car, Korra shuts the doors and metalbends a hole into the roof. Wu refuses to go outside, foring Korra to airbend him out; Kuvira's agents promptly begin to metalbend the roof of the adjourning car, peeling it back toward the Avatar's group and intending to trap them between themselves. Seeing no other option, Korra yells at her friends to jump over the side, which they do; Korra airbends them roughly, but unharmed, to the ground. Once safe, Wu emphatically thanks Mako for saving him, stating that he will probably get a raise; the latter insists he thank Korra for his freedom. In exchange for her efforts, Wu offers to take Korra on a date, and again, she bluntly refuses. She turns to Mako and Asami and the three of them turn nostalgic, remarking that their adventure was \"just like old times\". They share a group hug, in which Wu tries to include himself, but Korra holds him back at arm's length. She asks what they should do about Wu, thinking it to be too dangerous to return him to the hotel, a sentiment Wu wholly agrees with. Mako decides to hide him at Asami's ${link_1}, where his family has been staying since the fall of ${link_2}.
