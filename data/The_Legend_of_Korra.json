A title for the new mini-series, Avatar: Legend of Korra, was trademarked by Nickelodeon in May 2010 and leaked by the media shortly afterward; more information was revealed in late June 2010, just prior to the release of the feature film The Last Airbender. The new show was officially announced at the San Diego Comic-Con on July 22, 2010. It is darker and more mature than the original show; however, the creators are not attempting to target a new audience, intending to balance mature themes with a sense of fun and adventure. At that time, it was also announced that the series would run for twelve episodes."
