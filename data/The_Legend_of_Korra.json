Three years later, in 174 AG, the former captain of Zaofu's guard, Kuvira, has been traveling the Earth Kingdom with Bolin, Varrick, and her fianc\u00e9e, Baatar Jr., on a quest to reunite the nation after it fell into disarray following Queen Hou-Ting's death. When she was supposed to relinquish control to the newly crowned Earth King Wu, she denounced his authority and appointed herself the ruler of the Earth Empire. Meanwhile, Korra managed to heal physically, though she is still facing an emotional block caused by residual traces of mercury. With troubles coming to the Earth Kingdom, Team Avatar divided, and the Avatar's whereabouts unknown, the search for balance begins anew."
