Infuriated that Sokka bounced off his hut, a young thief and his friends attempt to mug the duo of their money, until Katara fends them off with waterbending. Katara and Sokka run toward the river, where Katara confidently threatens the boys, urging them to return Sokka's belongings and to leave them alone. Frightened, they comply, before being swept away by a wave Katara creates. While Katara heals him, Sokka suggests that they head to the tower they spotted while still in flight, as it was the only landmark visible for miles. While climbing, Sokka brings up Momo and Toph's vulnerability, which Katara confidently dismisses."
