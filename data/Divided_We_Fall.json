The earthbending man, ${link_1}, states that the trio will remain with Grandma Lokai forever, to which Aang, who has just arrived and misinterprets Onku's statement as one of imprisonment, angrily disagrees. He fights Onku with airbending until Katara stops him upon realization that the tower is ${link_2} and that Onku and the band of thieves she encountered earlier are all orphans. Grandma Lokai apologizes for the misunderstanding, and Toph reveals that Appa is safe, lounging in the courtyard.
