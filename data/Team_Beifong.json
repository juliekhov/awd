Master Kunyo had reclaimed the school in Toph's absence, stating that school had been a firebending academy prior to Toph's possession of the building, but that it had been abandoned because of the ${link_4}. However, now that ${link_5} ${link_6} had withdrawn his support for the plan, Master Kunyo and his disciples were set on reclaiming the building, stating that it was rightfully theirs. Before Toph and Kunyo could commence in a battle over the school and subsequently destroy the building, Sokka intervened and proposed to let the students fight for the rights of the building, as opposed to the masters. He proposed a \"match to the sit\", meaning that whichever team of students got another student to sit down first won the match and the school.",

      "text": "Following a brief trip with Team Avatar, Toph returned to her academy, accompanied by Sokka, just in time to find her students about to leave. She quickly scolded them, assuming they were abandoning their training. The students defended themselves by explaining that they were leaving not by choice, but because they had been kicked out by a rival school of firebenders, Master Kunyo's Firebending Dojo. Master Kunyo had reclaimed the school in Toph's absence, stating that school had been a firebending academy prior to Toph's possession of the building, but that it had been abandoned because of the Harmony Restoration Movement. However, now that Fire Lord Zuko had withdrawn his support for the plan, Master Kunyo and his disciples were set on reclaiming the building, stating that it was rightfully theirs. Before Toph and Kunyo could commence in a battle over the school and subsequently destroy the building, Sokka intervened and proposed to let the students fight for the rights of the building, as opposed to the masters. He proposed a \"match to the sit\", meaning that whichever team of students got another student to sit down first won the match and the school."

Despite Toph and Sokka's best efforts, the students were unable to perform metalbending at all. The evening prior to the battle, Team Beifong prepared to dissemble and leave the academy when they accidentally overheard Toph conversing with Sokka. She revealed to Sokka that she had been expecting her students to be something they were not, much like her parents forced her to do the same. She decided to forfeit the right of the school the next day to the firebending academy.",
