When Korra reported to Asami that the vessel was sand free, Kong told the girls that the engine room was the cleanest it had looked since it first came off the showroom floor. As Asami finished up welding the rudder, Kong reentered the airship to test the engine at the girl's request. The moment the engine's successfully started, however, the creature they had seen earlier, a ${link_0}, emerged from the sand and snapped the airship, leaving a stunned Kong in the pilot's seat. As Asami suggested building a makeshift ${link_1} of the remaining metal, Kong and his crewmates were ordered by the captain to gather up the material.",
