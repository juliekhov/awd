As Aang sees Sokka and Katara huddling behind a rock, his doppelganger attacks him, throwing him backward. He finds himself in the Fire Nation Avatar Temple; as the doors to the inner sanctum open, the doppelganger appears within, splitting the floor and causing Aang to fall through the crack. Landing on the deck of a Fire Nation ship, he looks up, finding himself face to face with the doppelganger, which has fused with La and taken the form of a giant koi fish. As the monstrous creature slashes at him, Aang wakes up, horrified and gasping."

As grateful as he is to know that Katara is concerned about him, Aang stands by his decision, still believing that what Fong is doing is right. Aang faults himself for being unable to stop the Hundred Year War and feels that he must try to do something about it. A saddened Katara leaves, telling him she will no longer watch their attempts to induce the Avatar State as she could not watch him do that to himself."
