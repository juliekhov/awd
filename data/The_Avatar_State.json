While Sokka agrees, seeing it as a simple, obvious shortcut, Katara is very much against it, believing Aang needs to keep mastering the elements in the proper manner. Aang tells her to be realistic, believing that he does not have the time to learn all the elements \"the right way,\" but she becomes upset and leaves the room, refusing to be a part of the plan. The next day, Fong begins testing Aang, attempting to trigger the Avatar State. First, he serves Aang a special herbal tea which increases energy ten-fold in soldiers, but it only gives Aang an energy rush. Sokka tries to scare Aang into the Avatar State, but it does not work. Fong organizes a ritual in which Aang wears clothing from all four nations and is bathed in all four elements, but it only makes him sneeze."
