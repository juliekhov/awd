When confronted about his kiss with Korra and his romantic feelings for the Avatar, Mako looked away guiltily and denied her accusation, stating that his reaction to Korra's capture was justified. Asami was left disappointed and hurt when Mako could not reassure her that she was just imagining things. Feeling betrayed, she ignored Mako and even told him to sit in the back seat of the Satomobile with Korra. She felt even more marginalized when Mako's attention was focused on Korra after Amon attacked Republic City, despite the fact her boyfriend was aware of how insecure she was feeling."

After coming to his senses, he became very determined to find her, almost beating up an Equalist in order to obtain a lead to Korra's whereabouts. When Naga returned with Korra on her back, Mako pushed Lin and Tenzin out of the way, demanding that they should \"give her some space\". Asami watched with a sad look as Mako carried Korra in his arms and told her how worried he was about her and how relieved he was that she was okay. Korra responded by telling him that she was okay, smiled, and rested her head against his chest while he carefully carried her atop Oogi. He laid her down, and gently brushed her face and the mark on her cheek to reassure her that she was safe. Korra responded to Mako's touch by relaxing and closing her eyes."

He later asked Asami to boil some water for Korra and she responded to Mako by telling him to heat it up himself because he was a firebender.

Later, when Kai was forcefully enlisted into the Earth Queen's first airbending regiment, Mako, Bolin, and Jinora were able to rescue him, but while Bolin was quick to accept Kai's apology for getting them stuck in the Lower Ring and stealing their wallets, Mako was more hesitant, remarking that he had a lot of money in his wallet."

After Tenzin, Korra, and Lin and her officers were defeated by Hiroshi's mecha tanks, Mako, along with Bolin, confronted him, claiming that everything Hiroshi had done for them was just a cover-up. Hiroshi confirmed this, stating that the most difficulty he had with it was witnessing his daughter fall for a \"firebending street rat\" and prepared to attack. After intervention from Asami, they managed to escape. Mako later apologized to Korra about not believing her, claiming that Hiroshi as an Equalist was hard to believe, even at that time."
