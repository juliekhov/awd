After traveling to the island aboard Appa, he sat on a ledge overlooking the ocean and meditated. After having entered the Spirit World, Roku and Fang took Aang on a trip through Roku's past, where he learned that Roku and Fire Lord Sozin were best friends. Aang was also surprised and delighted to find out that one of Roku's friends was none other than Monk Gyatso. Roku commented that Aang's relationship with Gyatso years later proves that some friendships are able to transcend lifetimes. After awakening from his vision with Roku, Aang told his friends Roku's story and that since Roku and Sozin were both Fire Nation natives, it proved any person is capable of great good or evil. The group takes comfort in Roku's words that friendships can transcend lifetimes."

While Zuko held off the airships and Azula, Aang and the others flew on Appa, proceeding to catch Zuko when he and his sister fell from the airship after their attacks clashed. When Katara announced that she was going to find the man who killed her mother, along with Zuko, Aang questioned her motives, even saying she sounded like Jet, and saying that he understood what she was feeling, mentioning Appa's theft by the sandbenders and his discovery of what happened to his people. When she decided to go anyway, he supported her, but asked her not to resort to violence and to let go of her anger. When Zuko and Katara came back, he said he was proud of her and told Zuko that violence is never the answer. He was subsequently asked by Zuko what he will do when he faces Ozai."

Next, Aang contacted Avatar Kyoshi, who told him of when she fought Chin the Conqueror, and how she would have done whatever it took to uphold justice. She advised Aang to let justice guide his way. Aang looked deeper inside himself and contacted Avatar Kuruk. Kuruk told him that when he was young, he generally played no part in shaping the world, since he lived during a time of great peace and people generally worked out their own problems. However, Koh the Face Stealer took Kuruk's wife away from him. Kuruk blamed himself for not being attentive enough and advised Aang to actively shape his destiny. Finally, seeking an Avatar who would be more sympathetic toward him, Aang contacted the Air Nomad Avatar, Yangchen. Aang told her how he was taught to respect all life and remove himself from the world to attain spiritual peace. Yangchen sympathized with him, but told him that the Avatar must sacrifice his spiritual well-being for the good of the world. Aang concluded that he had no choice but to kill the Fire Lord.",
