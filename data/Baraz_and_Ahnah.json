Upon noticing their Earth Empire military uniforms, they assumed they were working for Kuvira, despite the duo's insistence that they were deserters. After freeing the duo from the net, they bound their hands, intending to use them to pass a nearby border checkpoint. The waterbenders were bending water into their ${link_0}, while Bolin was asking how they had ended up in one of Kuvira's reeducation camps and Baraz tells him that Kuvira has been capturing and locking up everyone not of Earth Kingdom origin. Varrick asked where they were going and Baraz and Ahnah told them their goal. Bolin used his ${link_1} to keep them at bay, once again apologizing for what had happened to them and insisting that they were not aligned with Kuvira anymore, and Varrick adds that if he and Bolin\u00a0are recognized, they'll be taken back to Kuvira. Baraz was willing to believe him, to Ahnah's disappointment; she relented, however, when he reasoned that if Bolin wanted them dead, he'd have already buried them in lava. He continued by explaining that they needed to work together and trust each other in order to get past the border checkpoint which was the only way to freedom. Bolin cooled the lava and asked them where the checkpoint was. Even though Varrick pointed out that he and Bolin might be recognized, the group decided to take the risk regardless.",

Upon noticing their Earth Empire military uniforms, they assumed they were working for Kuvira, despite the duo's insistence that they were deserters. After freeing the duo from the net, they bound their hands, intending to use them to pass a nearby border checkpoint. The waterbenders were bending water into their water skins, while Bolin was asking how they had ended up in one of Kuvira's reeducation camps and Baraz tells him that Kuvira has been capturing and locking up everyone not of Earth Kingdom origin. Varrick asked where they were going and Baraz and Ahnah told them their goal. Bolin used his lavabending to keep them at bay, once again apologizing for what had happened to them and insisting that they were not aligned with Kuvira anymore, and Varrick adds that if he and Bolin\u00a0are recognized, they'll be taken back to Kuvira. Baraz was willing to believe him, to Ahnah's disappointment; she relented, however, when he reasoned that if Bolin wanted them dead, he'd have already buried them in lava. He continued by explaining that they needed to work together and trust each other in order to get past the border checkpoint which was the only way to freedom. Bolin cooled the lava and asked them where the checkpoint was. Even though Varrick pointed out that he and Bolin might be recognized, the group decided to take the risk regardless."
