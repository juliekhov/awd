      "text": "The ship's general appearance was very similar to that of the mainline Fire Navy ships, with a raised spiked bow that could be used as a ram that could be lowered to form a loading ramp. The bow was also suitable for breaching and invading shoreline fortifications. The entire ship was made out of metal and was a uniform gray color. It was approximately fifty meters long. The front section of the main deck was featureless except for a stair leading below decks and the hatch through which the catapult was deployed. The stern of the ship was rectangular, much like that of a real-world ferry. It might have been opened to form a ferry-like rear ramp, through which the riverboat might have been deployed. Below the stern the propellers were placed."
