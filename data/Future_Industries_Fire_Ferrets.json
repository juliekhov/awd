Fortunately for the team, Bolin spotted Pabu swimming in the water. He motioned him over and gestured for Pabu to bite through the rope, which the fire ferret did successfully. Korra left the team to fight the Equalists on her own, specifically seeking Amon. She did not get to him, though the Avatar was able to defeat the Lieutenant by knocking him off the arena's roof. However, she fell through the arena's roof, but had her life saved by Lin. Upon Korra's return, her teammates met her for a hug."
