The Fire Nation had arrested Haru and sent him to the prison rig. Once Katara learned of Haru's situation, she wanted to take action and find a way onto the rig. She decided the only solution was to convince the Fire Nation she was an earthbender. After some strategy, she was able to \"earthbend\" with the help of Aang and some ventilation pipes while the prison rig captain and two other Fire Nation soldiers were watching. The soldiers captured her and she was sent to the rig. There, she and some other captives met the warden, a self-important and cruel taskmaster. He stated that since the entire rig was made of metal, they were helpless because there was nothing for the earthbenders to control."

However, a group of children led by a teenage boy wielding dual hook swords suddenly descended from the trees and began combating the Fire Nation soldiers. The leader introduced himself as Jet and his allies as the Freedom Fighters. Katara very quickly developed a crush on Jet and shamelessly flattered him briefly. As Katara and Jet spoke, in the process indirectly insulting Sokka's instinctual behavior, The Duke and Pipsqueak raided the now-abandoned Fire Nation campsite, finding crates filled with jelly candy and barrels of explosive blasting jelly. When the Freedom Fighters mentioned bringing their score back to the hideout, Aang expressed interest, and Jet invited them to come. Katara eagerly accepted on behalf of the group. Katara expressed further infatuation with Jet, temperately praising his bravery, which provoked a sarcastic comment from Sokka."

Making a timely appearance, Sokka and the mechanist suddenly appeared with their newest invention: a war balloon. The Fire Nation did not attack the balloon, as they saw the Fire Nation insignia on it. Sokka dropped several slime bombs, but that did not stop the advancing army. Ultimately, Sokka, in a desperate maneuver, threw the balloon's hot air engine into a crack with explosive gas emanating from it. The resulting explosion crushed the invaders and resulted in victory for Team Avatar and the Earth Kingdom colony. Afterward, Aang stated his approval of the villagers having settled there."
