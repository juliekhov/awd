Before they could reach them, however, a nearby explosion, caused by P'Li's combustionbending, spooked the animals and they took off without the humans. Later that evening, a bison calf licked Kai while the young airbender was suspended upside down on a tree after being shot unconscious by P'Li. As he came to, the baby bison lowered himself, allowing Kai to descend upon his back. Earning a stroke on his head, the bison flew them out of there."

Parents are also protective of their young, flightless offspring and will attack anyone who gets near them. If the person is on good terms with the bison, however, they are allowed to get close to the calves.
