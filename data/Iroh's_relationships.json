Iroh urged Zhao to be careful what he wished for, warning that history was not always kind to its subjects. Zhao assured Iroh that the Siege of the North would be nothing like the Siege of Ba Sing Se. Iroh was a kindhearted man and retired former general, but he merely joined Zhao and tried to be a good warrior as he once was, not for the triumph of the Fire Nation, but solely for the welfare of his beloved nephew. On the second day of the naval siege against the Water Tribe, Iroh reminded Zhao that if the enemy was not defeated before the full moon rose, victory would be inevitable.
