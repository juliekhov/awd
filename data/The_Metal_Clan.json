Korra waves off the ${link_8}'s worry, noting that her current location is unknown to anyone but the people present. Having retrieved the ball, Naga places it on the ground in front of Lin, prompting Korra to translate the gesture as a desire for Lin to throw it. Eyeing the saliva and grass-covered object, the ${link_9} refuses to play along. That moment, ${link_10} and ${link_11} arrive and inform them of a new airbender in the city of ${link_12}, known as the home of the ${link_13}. Korra ask Lin if she knows of the place, and the latter becomes visibly uncomfortable, sidestepping the question by saying that she has not been. She emphasizes that she does not want Korra to go to Zaofu, and that it would ease her mind if Korra returned to ${link_14}. Korra apologizes to Lin, and states that, since Zaofu has a new airbender, she needs to go to Zaofu. As ${link_15} boards their ${link_16}, Naga begs the Chief of Police again to throw her ball by pushing the object closer toward her with her nose; an aggravated Lin uses her metal cable to puncture and deflate the toy, disappointing the ${link_17}.",

Annoyed over wasting time playing games, Lin declares that they should move on, as four dangerous criminals are still roaming free. Korra waves off the metalbender's worry, noting that her current location is unknown to anyone but the people present. Having retrieved the ball, Naga places it on the ground in front of Lin, prompting Korra to translate the gesture as a desire for Lin to throw it. Eyeing the saliva and grass-covered object, the Chief of Police refuses to play along. That moment, Mako and Asami arrive and inform them of a new airbender in the city of Zaofu, known as the home of the Metal Clan. Korra ask Lin if she knows of the place, and the latter becomes visibly uncomfortable, sidestepping the question by saying that she has not been. She emphasizes that she does not want Korra to go to Zaofu, and that it would ease her mind if Korra returned to Republic City. Korra apologizes to Lin, and states that, since Zaofu has a new airbender, she needs to go to Zaofu. As Team Avatar boards their airship, Naga begs the Chief of Police again to throw her ball by pushing the object closer toward her with her nose; an aggravated Lin uses her metal cable to puncture and deflate the toy, disappointing the polar bear dog."

Varrick asks Asami about how \"their\" company is doing, only for Asami to remind him that she regained full ownership because of Varrick's conspiracy to kidnap Raiko. The industrialist points out that, technically, he was not convicted; when Mako says it was because he escaped, the industrialist responds saying the universe saw fit to free him. Varrick declares that he looked up Suyin, pitched her some ideas, and went into business with her; he states that he is now the head of the matriarch's technology division, which primarily deals with the development of magnets and a high-speed rail. The mogul's presence angers Lin, who chastises her sister for harboring a criminal. Suyin remarks that a mistake shouldn't define a person and asserts that people can change; Lin states that Suyin hasn't changed at all and storms off.",

      "text": "As Zaofu prepares to seal its buildings at night, Korra and her group dine with Suyin's family and meet her husband, Baatar, and eldest son, whom she introduces as the architect and engineer responsible for the city's development. Opal and Bolin engage in conversation during dinner, with the former growing more attracted to the earthbender. Meanwhile, Suyin asks Korra how her search for airbenders has gone, to which the young Avatar replies that it has not been as successful as planned. She recalls the team's recent rescue of airbenders from Earth Queen Hou-Ting's custody, prompting Suyin to declare that the Queen's rule is outdated and needs to evolve alongside the changing nation. As Lin makes a bitter comment about Suyin's apparent expertise in global affairs, Varrick and Zhu Li enter the dining hall, much to Bolin's surprise and Asami and Mako's annoyance. Varrick asks Asami about how \"their\" company is doing, only for Asami to remind him that she regained full ownership because of Varrick's conspiracy to kidnap Raiko. The industrialist points out that, technically, he was not convicted; when Mako says it was because he escaped, the industrialist responds saying the universe saw fit to free him. Varrick declares that he looked up Suyin, pitched her some ideas, and went into business with her; he states that he is now the head of the matriarch's technology division, which primarily deals with the development of magnets and a high-speed rail. The mogul's presence angers Lin, who chastises her sister for harboring a criminal. Suyin remarks that a mistake shouldn't define a person and asserts that people can change; Lin states that Suyin hasn't changed at all and storms off."

In her office, Suyin tells Korra that she created the city as a way to make her mark on the world. She reminisces about her past, saying that she and Lin competed for their mother's affection during their childhood, which strained their relationship. Although Toph gave the two all the freedom they wanted to discover their respective paths, Suyin reveals that she ultimately was disappointed by how her daughters chose to live their lives. The matriarch recounts that she left to travel the world at the age of sixteen, and that during her journey, she discovered that what she wanted was a family. She then purchased empty Earth Kingdom land, which she developed into Zaofu. Korra remarks that her life sounds perfect, but Suyin sadly remarks that, while she has always wanted Lin to be a part of it, she has given up any hope of reconciling with her.",
