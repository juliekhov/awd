Before the attacking biplane had the chance to drop even more bombs, Iroh launched an upward firebending blast, causing the bombs to detonate in the attacking aircraft's bomb bay, effectively destroying it. Soon after this success, Iroh was forced to abandon his biplane, as it was headed straight for the statue of Avatar Aang on Aang Memorial Island. After Iroh jumped out and grabbed onto the Equalist banner hanging from the statue's staff, the plane he had stolen crashed into the statue's head, causing the giant Amon mask to fall off and Iroh thanked Aang for saving him.",
