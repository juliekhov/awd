Plans changed, however, and Korra did not accompany the family to Aang's home temple. As soon as Oogi landed on temple ground, the family was greeted by a delegation of Air Acolytes\u00a0led by Abbot Shung. Bumi and Kya, who accompanied the family, were also greeted with reverence by a female acolyte, as she believed them to be airbenders as well. She promptly apologized for the misunderstanding and left the siblings to continue her work."
