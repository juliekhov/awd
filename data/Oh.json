He pursued them with his fellow pirates through the small town in an attempt to retrieve the stolen item, and managed to corner them, threatening to kill them. However, his plans were foiled by Aang, who airbent at him to provide cover for their escape. As the friends flew over, Oh received a kick in the face from Sokka, and could do nothing more than witness their escape."
