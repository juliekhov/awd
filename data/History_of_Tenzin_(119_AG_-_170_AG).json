Katara came out from the back room, announcing that nothing was working and she could not restore Korra's powers. Tenzin wanted to comfort Korra when she came out from the back room, but Korra took off on Naga. Mako tried to follow her, but Tenzin restrained him, saying that she needed time to come to terms with what had happened to her. Korra went to a cliff and cried her heart out, sitting on the ground, her head buried in her arms. In the background, a person wearing Air Nomad attire walked up. Korra had mistaken the person for Tenzin, but when she looked she saw it was Aang, who subsequently restored her ability to bend. After Korra regained her bending, she was able to give bending abilities back to those who had it removed. When she gave Lin her earthbending back by using energybending, Tenzin, who had been in awe watching her, walked up the steps and told her \"I am so proud of you, Avatar Korra.\""
