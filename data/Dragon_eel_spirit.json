Defending the humans against the enraged spirits, Korra pleaded the dragon eel spirit to call off the others, but they refused to do so, telling her that it had been her responsibility to protect the area and that she had failed. Korra tried to reason with them, saying that while they might believe they were protecting their world, attacking the humans\u2014who were already afraid of the spirits\u2014would only escalate the conflict. Her argumentation further enraged the spirit, however, who turned dark while pointing out that it was the humans who had started the fight and that one of them had to pay. Korra urged the spirit to stop but left them alone when she saw Asami was in trouble. As the now unhindered spirit neared the Triple Threats' leader, ${link_3} threw three knives at them, though they flew right through the spirit, and they knocked him over. The dragon eel spirit, rounding on Tokuga, held him responsible for disturbing the portal, an action for which he would have to live with the consequences, and charged again, this time moving through Tokuga, deforming him in the process.

      "text": "The dragon eel spirit later returned during the Triple Threat Triad's attack on the airbenders and Team Avatar, who were defending the spirit portal. Emerging from the portal with several others, they ordered the spirits, most of whom had turned dark, to protect the portal, upon which the spirits lashed out against the Triple Threats. Defending the humans against the enraged spirits, Korra pleaded the dragon eel spirit to call off the others, but they refused to do so, telling her that it had been her responsibility to protect the area and that she had failed. Korra tried to reason with them, saying that while they might believe they were protecting their world, attacking the humans\u2014who were already afraid of the spirits\u2014would only escalate the conflict. Her argumentation further enraged the spirit, however, who turned dark while pointing out that it was the humans who had started the fight and that one of them had to pay. Korra urged the spirit to stop but left them alone when she saw Asami was in trouble. As the now unhindered spirit neared the Triple Threats' leader, Tokuga threw three knives at them, though they flew right through the spirit, and they knocked him over. The dragon eel spirit, rounding on Tokuga, held him responsible for disturbing the portal, an action for which he would have to live with the consequences, and charged again, this time moving through Tokuga, deforming him in the process. Having exacted their revenge, the dragon eel spirit returned to their normal form and retreated into the Spirit World, ordering the other spirits to do the same."
