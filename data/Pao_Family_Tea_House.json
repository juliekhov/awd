Four tables were placed at each side of the shop, leaving a broad pathway in the middle for the waiters. They were placed far enough apart to allow the waiters to maneuver freely from one table to the next for refills, but close enough to create the cozy atmosphere of a local family business. The tables were sized to accommodate two people facing each other while enjoying their tea."

The counter was split in two by the broad pathway dividing the shop that gave the waiters easy access to the tea-brewing area. A supply cabinet, supporting many shelves with bags, pots and kettles, was placed against the left wall in the corner, while a ladder provided access to the supplies stacked on the high shelf on the right. Under this shelf were numerous intricate nature paintings. Located between these shelves was the entrance to the small alcove that contained the stone fireplace where the various teas were prepared and the sink to wash dishes. Three plain yellow tapestries were strung over the entrance to prevent the smoke of the cooking fire from rising and filling up the main room.",
