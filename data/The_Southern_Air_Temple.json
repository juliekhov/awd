As the duel progresses, Zhao seems more than a match for Zuko, effortlessly avoiding and nullifying all of his fire blasts. As the prince catches his breath, Iroh continues to advise Zuko to remember his basics. Zhao throws his own volley of fire blasts; Zuko is able to block each attack, but he is slowly forced back with every parry he makes. For the final blast, Zhao, using both fists, sends a ball of fire that connects solidly with Zuko, knocking him to the ground. Pressing his advantage, Zhao leaps into the air, covers the distance separating him and Zuko, and prepares a finishing blast aimed directly for the prince's exposed face. An instant before contact, Zuko rolls out of the way, rises with a kicking flourish, and knocks Zhao out of his stance."

Zhao expects Zuko to administer a final, devastating blow to mark his victory, but the latter's fire blast lands beside his face instead; when Zhao insults him for what he perceives to be cowardice, Zuko promises that he will not show restraint, should Zhao seek to get in his way in the future. As the victorious prince walks away, a beaten and furious Zhao sends a jet of fire at Zuko's back. Iroh intervenes, however, stopping the attack with his bare hand and throwing the commander to the ground. As Iroh stands over Zhao, Zuko tries to attack Zhao once more, but his uncle tells him not to taint his victory by retaliating. Iroh lectures Zhao about the dishonor he has brought upon himself through his actions and states that his nephew, even in exile, has proved himself to be more honorable. He politely thanks Zhao for sharing his tea and turns away from him, leaving the defeated commander to pick himself up; he groans as he watches them go. After leaving the arena, Zuko asks Iroh if he truly meant what he said, to which his uncle responds, \"Of course. I told you ginseng tea is my favorite.\" As the two walk back toward the ship, the faintest of smiles crosses Prince Zuko's lips.",
