After leaving there, she traveled with her family to the Southern Air Temple where she was greeted kindly by the Air Acolytes residing there. However, after seeing Jinora receiving a book as present by one Air Acolyte, she grew quickly jealous. Ikki took the book away from her elder sibling, claiming it to be her gift. Jinora argued that she did not even liked to read, but Ikki just stuck her tongue at her. She later raced around the temple's sanctuary with her brother on an air scooter after her father had left them unattended whilst taking Jinora to the Avatar sanctuary in the temple. Soon after, Ikki was teased by Jinora and Meelo, causing her to run off, which prompted a search led by her father, aunt, and uncle."
