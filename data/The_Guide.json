Upon hearing this, Asami comforts Mako, prompting Bolin to conclude that the two have already rekindled their relationship, despite the fact that Mako broke up with Korra a mere week earlier. The two deny this accusation, and Mako tries to convince Asami and Bolin once more that Varrick is responsible for the attack of his own ships and the raid on Future Industries. He tells the two that the explosives Varrick uses in his movers are identical to the ones described by the captain of one of the ships ambushed at sea, and that the detonators used are identical to the one he found outside the Southern Water Tribe Cultural Center just after it was bombed by the Agni Kai Triad, but they tell him that the explosives are the kind anyone could have gotten their hands on. Exasperated over Asami and Bolin's reluctance to accept the truth, Mako storms off, but is confronted by two of Varrick's guards before he can leave."
