They land, only to find out that it was burned down by Fire Nation soldiers. Aang feels guilty and blames himself for the incident, stating that it is the Avatar's duty to protect nature. However, Katara assures him that the forest will grow back and shows him the abundance of acorns scattered on the ground. The party is startled when an old man comes asking the Avatar for his help. He leads them to Senlin Village, where many of the buildings are in ruins, and Aang learns that it is being terrorized by a spirit known as Hei Bai. The villagers ask Aang for his help and he agrees to help, although he is very much skeptical of what he can actually do to save the village."
