A few weeks after Harmonic Convergence, Aiwei, after having escaped Zaofu, rented a room at the Misty Palms Inn. After tracking the truth seer to the oasis, Team Avatar entered the village, though soon left again after noticing that Earth Queen Hou-Ting had their wanted posters put up. In order to continue their search for Aiwei, Mako and Bolin donned disguises and returned. However, it was not long before they were discovered by Macao and Lily, two fierce-looking individuals who had recognized Bolin. Under the impression that they were bounty hunters, the two brothers ran for cover. As they intended to leave, Bolin spotted Aiwei returning to his inn room. After getting Asami and Korra, the foursome tried to get a room across from Aiwei's, though were initially denied, as the innkeeper had bad prior experiences with youths. At that moment, Lily and Macao found them again. Team Avatar instantly readied for battle, though the duo turned out to be fans of The Adventures of Nuktuk: Hero of the South and were after an autograph of Bolin. Due to his reputation as a mover star, the innkeeper changed her mind and agreed to rent the team a room. That night, a fight broke out between Mako and Bolin and Ghazan and Ming-Hua, destroying part of the inn's inner court."
