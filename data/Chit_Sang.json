While Chit Sang attempted to peacefully go back to his cell, the guard deliberately provoked a response by attacking him with a fire whip, forcing him to defend himself using firebending. He was taken to the cooler for breaking prison rules, which stated firebending was forbidden. While in the cooler, Chit Sang was visited by the warden, who had apparently heard that Chit Sang had tried to use firebending to escape. The warden reminded him that no person had ever escaped from the Boiling Rock and stated that he would rather jump in the boiling lake than have that record be broken."
