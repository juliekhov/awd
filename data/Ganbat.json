Soon after, the truck was rammed by Oogi and knocked back by another adult bison, who attacked it with a powerful air swipe. Recognizing his defeat, Ganbat exited the truck and surrendered, but he was promptly assaulted by Kai, who continued to attack him out of rage until he was restrained by Tenzin. Following the incident, Bumi and the other airbenders apprehended the bison rustlers and locked them in the cages they used to trap bison calves, before reminding Ganbat and the others never to mess with an airbender's bison."
