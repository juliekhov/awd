The poachers erected walls of earth to shield themselves from the air blasts, while Ganbat attacked Kai with a series of earth columns before the latter could attack the other poachers. He used the same technique to fend off two other airbenders and proceeded to battle Meelo, whom he attempted to trap in an earth cage. Despite his efforts, Meelo evaded the attack and knocked Ganbat down, forcing him to flee the scene on a truck carrying Jinora and the captured baby bison."

Although he generally avoids confrontation, Ganbat is ruthless in battle, using primarily offensive attacks meant to debilitate or otherwise severely injure his opponents.
