Behind each bender is calligraphy similar to that seen in the background of the original series. It subsequently shows a picture of Team Avatar, followed by a map of the Avatar World. After that, Tenzin explains the transformation of the Fire Nation colonies into the United Republic of Nations, before the picture zooms in on the capital: Republic City. A statue of Aang is seen on an island in the bay, and it is explained how the Avatar accomplished many remarkable feats in his life, before he eventually died and was reborn into the next nation of the Avatar Cycle. As of the second episode, the opening sequence is much shorter; the display of bending is abridged to show only a few seconds of each element and the sequence skips over the origin of Republic City to show the statue of Aang, with Korra nearby striking a similar pose."
