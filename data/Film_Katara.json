      "body": "When Katara and her brother went on a hunting expedition for their village, she practiced waterbending near their boat at an iceberg but lost control of the water, but accidentally got Sokka soaked. Katara told Sokka that her bending had improved and she had thought about their mom that time, but Sokka told her to stop bending water around him because he always gets wet. They both followed Tiger-Seal tracks leading them to an empty field of flat ice. Katara noticed a glowing patch of ice beneath her feet. Sokka knelt down and struck the ice three times with his boomerang. Suddenly there was a sound of ice cracking and huge cracks began to appear in the ice. They ran away and avoided the cracks. They turned around just in time to see a huge sphere of ice burst out of the ground and the first thing Katara noticed about the ice sphere was that there seemed to be a person frozen inside. Sokka prepared to leave thinking it was a \"Fire Nation trick\" but Katara grabbed his boomerang and struck the sphere of ice causing a huge crack to appear in it. She hit it a second time and the crack burst open. A blast of air shot out of it and Katara was blown across the ice and slammed into Sokka, knocking him down. A beam of white-blue light shot into the sky as it cracked open. Inside this iceberg Katara and Sokka discovered a sleeping boy and decided to carry him to their village with his \"bison creature\" following them along the icy shore line.

Katara told Sokka that her bending had improved and she had thought about their mom that time, but Sokka told her to stop bending water around him because he always gets wet. They both followed Tiger-Seal tracks leading them to an empty field of flat ice. Katara noticed a glowing patch of ice beneath her feet. Sokka knelt down and struck the ice three times with his boomerang. Suddenly there was a sound of ice cracking and huge cracks began to appear in the ice. They ran away and avoided the cracks. They turned around just in time to see a huge sphere of ice burst out of the ground and the first thing Katara noticed about the ice sphere was that there seemed to be a person frozen inside. Sokka prepared to leave thinking it was a \"Fire Nation trick\" but Katara grabbed his boomerang and struck the sphere of ice causing a huge crack to appear in it. She hit it a second time and the crack burst open. A blast of air shot out of it and Katara was blown across the ice and slammed into Sokka, knocking him down. A beam of white-blue light shot into the sky as it cracked open. Inside this iceberg Katara and Sokka discovered a sleeping boy and decided to carry him to their village with his \"bison creature\" following them along the icy shore line.

      "text": "In The Last Airbender, Katara is played by Nicola Peltz. In an interview with People magazine, M. Night Shyamalan claimed that he did not want to make The Last Airbender without Nicola Peltz, \"I said that only once before in my career, and that was when I met Haley in The Sixth Sense auditions.\" Peltz was familiar with the waterbending character before submitting for the part of Katara, having faithfully watched Avatar: The Last Airbender, the animated series on which the film is based, with her younger twin brothers. She describes her character as being a big role model with young girls and women, \"She's really mentally and physically strong, strong-willed and -minded, but she's also caring and compassionate ... The movie has a lot of values, but it's also fun. It's fantasy, but it's also a really cool battle between good and evil.\" She explained that she initially did not know about Jackson Rathbone starring in the \"Twilight\" films until after she met him and said that working with Shyamalan was an amazing experience."
