He woke the airbenders at dawn with a large blast from a horn before leading them on an exhausting ten-mile hike, but he kept them pushing onward to meditation lessons, saying the chilled group could warm themselves with their breathing. He promptly dismissed Bumi's concerns, going right into meditation."

      "text": "Tenzin managed to survive the explosion and emerged from the rubble with everyone else when Bolin lifted a large piece of concrete. He quickly assessed Kuvira's progress from atop a rooftop and alerted everyone that she was heading their way with a battalion of mecha suits. While Asami and Varrick attempted to adapt the prototypes of the hummingbird mecha suits in Asami's office to get them airborne, he and the other benders faced Kuvira and her army in an attempt to stop them or at the very least, slow them down. On Meelo's urging, Tenzin and the other airbenders equipped themselves with balloons filled with paint. Upon reaching the enormous mecha suit, they dropped the balloons on the suit's windows, momentarily obscuring its vision. Tenzin signaled Lin, Wei, and Wing on the ground to try metalbending the joints of the suit, though they soon discovered the joints were made out of platinum and thus impervious to their bending. After Wei and Wing tied the machine's legs together with metal cables and Bolin gave the signal, Tenzin and the other airbenders blasted the suit with air currents in an attempt to knock it off balance. The suit managed to stabilize itself, however, forcing him and the others to flee when Kuvira fired her spirit cannon at them. Sitting dazed on the ground, Jinora checked up on him to see if he was all right, before they all retreated to Asami's office, where a new plan was formed: the benders would relentlessly attack the mecha suit to distract Kuvira and enable the two hummingbird mecha suits to land on the enormous machine and cut a hole in it without being crushed."
