In the one-sided conversation that follows, Korra tries and fails to convince the spirit that she is the ${link_4}, on a mission to close the portal. As she talks, a multitude of meerkat spirits appear from the ground and bombard Korra with blunt skepticism and disbelief. Frustrated, Korra attempts to use ${link_5} to fend off the spirits but finds herself unable to do so, having meditated into the Spirit World. Outraged, the spirits attack Korra by throwing themselves at her and transforming into a thick, purple goo upon impact.
