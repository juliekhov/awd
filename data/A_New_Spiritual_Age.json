Korra initially dismisses Vaatu's threats and continues toward the portal, but when Vaatu threatens Jinora's safety, Korra turns to see Unalaq holding Jinora captive. The chief threatens to corrupt Jinora's soul unless Korra opens the northern portal. Korra advances on the duo though when she reaches the base of the Tree of Time, her progress is thwarted by a dark Furry-Foot. Looking around, Korra notices that the three guardian spirits have returned to their dark form as well. Korra blames Unalaq for deceiving her, making her believe he wanted to restore balance with the spirits. Pointing out that turning the spirits dark is not balance, she demands him to release Jinora. Dismissing Korra's demand, Unalaq makes it clear that Jinora will only leave the Spirit World alive if both portals are open. When Jinora begs Korra to refuse, Unalaq increases his hold on her, coming near to completely corrupting Jinora to emphasize that he is not bluffing. Unwilling to sacrifice her friend, Korra concedes and opens the portal, causing Vaatu's restrictive barrier to weaken."

Weaving through her uncle's waterbending attacks, Korra makes her way over to where Furry-Foot is holding Jinora though before she can truly reach them, the dark spirit takes off with the young airbender. Korra gives chase though is knocked over and captured herself by the dark guardian spirits. Seizing his chance, Unalaq raises his spiritbending water around an semi-unconscious Korra, attempting to destroy her spirit. Before he can do so, however, the dragon bird spirit whom Korra saved swoops down upon them, knocking Unalaq off his feet with its tail, sending him tumbling. The spirit takes Korra, almost unconscious and powerless, in its talons and flies away from the portals. As she is carried off to safety, Vaatu calls after Raava, announcing that he will be free from his prison once Harmonic Converge arrives to have his revenge.",
