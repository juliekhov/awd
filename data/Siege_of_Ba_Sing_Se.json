Despite this victory, the long siege left many bitter feelings toward the Fire Nation and Iroh, specifically. These feelings were displayed when an ${link_0} captured Iroh, longing for vengeance for the chaos and violence he and his nation had wrought during the siege. Iroh was derided by his people for letting his own emotions interfere with the outcome of the battle. However, many in the Fire Nation who served under his command, despite the ultimate failure of Iroh's siege and even after his overt treachery in Ba Sing Se, praised him as \"a great leader and a great man\". While his nephew ${link_1} ${link_2}, sister-in-law Princess ${link_3}, and father, ${link_4} ${link_5}, sympathized with Iroh's loss, his niece Princess ${link_6} and younger brother Prince ${link_7} were disgusted by Iroh's decisions. Ozai, intending to take advantage of Iroh's losses and the failure of the siege, requested that his father Azulon let him succeed the throne in Iroh's place, arguing that Lu Ten's death had left Iroh without a proper heir. Azulon was infuriated by this proposal and swore to punish Ozai. However, before this could be done, Azulon died suddenly and Ursa disappeared. Iroh, emotionally wrecked, was too upset to fight for his throne, and therefore Ozai became Fire Lord on Azulon's alleged dying wish.

      "text": "The Siege of Ba Sing Se resulted in victory for the Earth Kingdom, and the Outer Wall was eventually repaired. Despite this victory, the long siege left many bitter feelings toward the Fire Nation and Iroh, specifically. These feelings were displayed when an earthbender captain captured Iroh, longing for vengeance for the chaos and violence he and his nation had wrought during the siege. Iroh was derided by his people for letting his own emotions interfere with the outcome of the battle. However, many in the Fire Nation who served under his command, despite the ultimate failure of Iroh's siege and even after his overt treachery in Ba Sing Se, praised him as \"a great leader and a great man\". While his nephew Prince Zuko, sister-in-law Princess Ursa, and father, Fire Lord Azulon, sympathized with Iroh's loss, his niece Princess Azula and younger brother Prince Ozai were disgusted by Iroh's decisions. Ozai, intending to take advantage of Iroh's losses and the failure of the siege, requested that his father Azulon let him succeed the throne in Iroh's place, arguing that Lu Ten's death had left Iroh without a proper heir. Azulon was infuriated by this proposal and swore to punish Ozai. However, before this could be done, Azulon died suddenly and Ursa disappeared. Iroh, emotionally wrecked, was too upset to fight for his throne, and therefore Ozai became Fire Lord on Azulon's alleged dying wish. Iroh lost his birthright and his son as a result of the siege, and Ba Sing Se did not fall until Dai Li agents, along with Zuko, Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee, overthrew the Earth King six years later."
