The building in which his school was located was confiscated and sold to Toph Beifong, who transformed it into the ${link_1}. However, after ${link_2} ${link_3} withdrew his support for the movement in 101 AG, Kunyo returned with his three students to reclaim his property. When he arrived back at the building, only ${link_4}, ${link_5}, and ${link_6} were present, and he easily managed to drive them out of the school. However, right after he had reclaimed ownership of the building, Toph returned and proved to be a much tougher opponent than her three students. Kunyo laughed at Toph when he found out that she was teaching ${link_7}, as he thought that it was impossible, a mere fantasy. However, Toph proved him wrong by metalbending one of the spears that served as wall decoration around his head.

The building in which his school was located was confiscated and sold to Toph Beifong, who transformed it into the Beifong Metalbending Academy. However, after Fire Lord Zuko withdrew his support for the movement in 101 AG, Kunyo returned with his three students to reclaim his property. When he arrived back at the building, only Ho Tun, Penga, and The Dark One were present, and he easily managed to drive them out of the school. However, right after he had reclaimed ownership of the building, Toph returned and proved to be a much tougher opponent than her three students. Kunyo laughed at Toph when he found out that she was teaching metalbending, as he thought that it was impossible, a mere fantasy. However, Toph proved him wrong by metalbending one of the spears that served as wall decoration around his head.

He appeared to have won back his school when a hopeless Toph surrendered. However, her attempt to sit down and surrender was thwarted when her metalbending students came back to the facility trying to stop her, as Ho Tun suddenly metalbent a coin. Aggravated, and presuming this to be a \"dirt people trick\", Kunyo ordered his disciples to attack, but he found that their firebending was useless against the metal coins of their opponents. Nonetheless, Kunyo demanded that his disciples continue firebending, until he was knocked on his face when he was hit multiple times with several of these coins, causing him to fall sat down and lose the battle. Defeated, he walked away, supported by his students, re-allowing Toph control the academy.",
