The last of his proud lineage who did not follow the Fire Lord during the war, Shyu defied the Fire Nation authorities and his fellow Fire Sages by remaining loyal to the Avatar. He firmly believed that once Avatar Roku returned to the sanctuary, all the sages would pay a price for serving Fire Lord Ozai, who had set forth a decree stating that anyone who aided the Avatar would be branded a traitor by the Fire Nation and handled accordingly. Serving, at age sixty, as the youngest of the five Fire Sages of Crescent Island, he helped Aang communicate with Roku's spirit during the winter solstice in 99 AG, an action which led to his imprisonment as traitor by the Fire Nation. However, after the fall of the old regime and Fire Lord Zuko's rise to power, Shyu was released and became the new Great Sage as well as the leader of the Fire Nation Capital's sages."
