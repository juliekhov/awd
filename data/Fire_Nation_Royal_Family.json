After a relatively even battle on the gondola, Azula and Ty Lee noticed that the gondola was about to be cut down by prison guards and escaped. However, before the gondola with Zuko and other prison-break participants was cut from the wire, Mai intervened and saved them. This led to Azula's attempt to kill Mai. Ty Lee managed to stop Azula in time with her chi blocking, but she and Mai were captured by the guards and imprisoned. This betrayal caused Azula to slip into insanity, but this would not become evident until the arrival of Sozin's Comet."
