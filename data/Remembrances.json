At the Sato estate, Mako recounts his past to Prince Wu, explaining how he and Korra met and his complicated relationships with the Avatar and Asami. On Air Temple Island, Korra reveals to Asami the doubt she feels, both in herself and her position as bringer of balance; despite her efforts, her enemies threw the world into disorder, and she feels as though it no longer needs her. Asami is aided in her efforts to raise Korra's spirits by Tenzin, who tells her that the purpose of facing conflicts is to learn and grow from them, noting that Korra has done that. Meanwhile, as their boat makes its way north, Varrick entertains the Earth Empire fugitives with an idea for a mover; he envisions Nuktuk playing the part of a fictional Bolin, who single-handedly defeats all of Korra's main enemies after they formed a diabolical team.",

      "text": "Team Avatar reminisces about the past several years, thinking back on themselves and their friends. At the Sato estate, Mako recounts his past to Prince Wu, explaining how he and Korra met and his complicated relationships with the Avatar and Asami. On Air Temple Island, Korra reveals to Asami the doubt she feels, both in herself and her position as bringer of balance; despite her efforts, her enemies threw the world into disorder, and she feels as though it no longer needs her. Asami is aided in her efforts to raise Korra's spirits by Tenzin, who tells her that the purpose of facing conflicts is to learn and grow from them, noting that Korra has done that. Meanwhile, as their boat makes its way north, Varrick entertains the Earth Empire fugitives with an idea for a mover; he envisions Nuktuk playing the part of a fictional Bolin, who single-handedly defeats all of Korra's main enemies after they formed a diabolical team."

Asami tells Korra Toph's assertion is ridiculous, but Korra tells her Toph is right; despite everything she has done, the world is still in imbalance. She explains herself through a flashback of her own, telling Asami her own history. When she learned she was the ${link_4}, she remembers, she greatly anticipated her future, believing that she \"was really gonna change things\", but she had been na\u00efve. When she saw ${link_5} remove Lightning Bolt Zolt's bending, she was utterly terrified, and when he did the same to her, her worst nightmare was realized. Asami interrupts Korra's train of thought for a moment, reminding her that after Korra exposed Amon and stopped the ${link_6} Movement, the free elections that followed in the United Republic gave nonbenders a voice, and people had found their hope again. She states that good things came of her struggle; Korra counters by reminding her that, although she had beaten Amon, ${link_7} followed soon after, and his threatening Jinora's life led her to betray ${link_8} and open the portals, which further threw the ${link_9} and human worlds into chaos and led to, not only the fusion of Unalaq and ${link_10}, but a temporary separation from ${link_11} and a permanent loss of her connection with her past lives. Asami retorts that, by the end of the conflict, she had become more stronger, as ${link_12} had been, and that by opening the portals, she brought back the Air Nation and caused a positive shift in the world. Again doubting herself, Korra moves on to ${link_13}, who also received ${link_14}; besides nearly killing her with his newfound power, he had thrown the ${link_15} into chaos by killing the ${link_16}, and nearly done the same to the rest of the airbenders. In the wake of his defeat, Kuvira gained power, and the world was, again, thrown out of balance.

      "text": "At Air Temple Island, Korra watches the sunset with a serious expression on her face. Asami brings her a cup of tea; sensing something is wrong, she asks if she is okay, and Korra repeats to her the sentiment of Toph regarding their current situation: the world does not need the Avatar, and confronting Kuvira is purposeless. Asami tells Korra Toph's assertion is ridiculous, but Korra tells her Toph is right; despite everything she has done, the world is still in imbalance. She explains herself through a flashback of her own, telling Asami her own history. When she learned she was the Avatar, she remembers, she greatly anticipated her future, believing that she \"was really gonna change things\", but she had been na\u00efve. When she saw Amon remove Lightning Bolt Zolt's bending, she was utterly terrified, and when he did the same to her, her worst nightmare was realized. Asami interrupts Korra's train of thought for a moment, reminding her that after Korra exposed Amon and stopped the Equalist Movement, the free elections that followed in the United Republic gave nonbenders a voice, and people had found their hope again. She states that good things came of her struggle; Korra counters by reminding her that, although she had beaten Amon, Unalaq followed soon after, and his threatening Jinora's life led her to betray Tenzin and open the portals, which further threw the Spirit and human worlds into chaos and led to, not only the fusion of Unalaq and Vaatu, but a temporary separation from Raava and a permanent loss of her connection with her past lives. Asami retorts that, by the end of the conflict, she had become more stronger, as UnaVaatu had been, and that by opening the portals, she brought back the Air Nation and caused a positive shift in the world. Again doubting herself, Korra moves on to Zaheer, who also received airbending; besides nearly killing her with his newfound power, he had thrown the Earth Kingdom into chaos by killing the Earth Queen, and nearly done the same to the rest of the airbenders. In the wake of his defeat, Kuvira gained power, and the world was, again, thrown out of balance. From the beginning of her recollection to the present, she notes with frustration, nothing has changed."
