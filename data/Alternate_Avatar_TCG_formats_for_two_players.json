When an opponent in the match scores a point, the defeated player must remove the top Chamber Card from his or her playing mat. Once a person has lost all of his or her Chambers, that person loses. Five booster packs are recommended for this incarnation of the game. Like in Rip N' Flip, trait requirements are not to be bothered with.
