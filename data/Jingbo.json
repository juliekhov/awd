He was catapulted over the fence by Aang's ${link_0} and caught with his ${link_1}, although he still landed on his back, the heavy backpack preventing the young boy from immediately getting back up. His predicament only worsened when four guards arrived and tried to expel them from the private grounds for trespassing. Aang used his airbending once more to blow the Air Acolytes out of harm's way when the guards attacked them with earthbending, causing Jingbo to be squished by his backpack. He was helped to his feet by his fellow Acolytes and subsequently received another lesson about Air Nomad tradition from Aang: avoid conflict unless absolutely necessary, and even then, contact should be kept to a minimum. Together with the other Acolytes, he applauded the Avatar for his demonstration of the lesson by using his airbending to let the attacking guards knock each other out. When ${link_2} arrived on the scene, Jingbo declined shaking his hand in greeting, though politely bowed his head in line with Air Nomad custom. He later attended a tour of the ${link_3} with the others, though grew worried when Aang once again stared off in the distance to ${link_4}'s apparition, who was only visible to the Avatar, wondering if there was something he could do to help Aang.",

When the group ventured through town, he followed Aang, Katara, and the other Air Acolytes toward a fenced-off area from which a repugnant smell arose. He was catapulted over the fence by Aang's earthbending and caught with his airbending, although he still landed on his back, the heavy backpack preventing the young boy from immediately getting back up. His predicament only worsened when four guards arrived and tried to expel them from the private grounds for trespassing. Aang used his airbending once more to blow the Air Acolytes out of harm's way when the guards attacked them with earthbending, causing Jingbo to be squished by his backpack. He was helped to his feet by his fellow Acolytes and subsequently received another lesson about Air Nomad tradition from Aang: avoid conflict unless absolutely necessary, and even then, contact should be kept to a minimum. Together with the other Acolytes, he applauded the Avatar for his demonstration of the lesson by using his airbending to let the attacking guards knock each other out. When Satoru arrived on the scene, Jingbo declined shaking his hand in greeting, though politely bowed his head in line with Air Nomad custom. He later attended a tour of the Earthen Fire Refinery with the others, though grew worried when Aang once again stared off in the distance to Yangchen's apparition, who was only visible to the Avatar, wondering if there was something he could do to help Aang."
