Korra demands he let Tenzin and his family go, prompting Amon to taunt her, saying she is welcome to try and save them. Mako cautions Korra that Amon is baiting them, but the situation gives them no other option. Mako fires lightning at Amon, forcing him away from the airbenders. Using firebending to give them supporting force, Mako and Korra run on the face of the adjacent wall and land on the stage, hurling fire blasts to further push Amon and his forces back. Korra releases Tenzin while asking him if he knows the location of Pema, Rohan, or Lin Beifong. Tenzin replies that he knows where Pema and the baby are imprisoned, but is clueless as to Lin's whereabouts. Freed, Tenzin rushes to the front of the battle and airbends gales of wind, knocking the remaining Equalist guards off the stage, and finally Amon who had been evading incoming fire and air. As the fighting continues, Korra releases the three kids and they escape into a backstage corridor."
