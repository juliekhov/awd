Mako cautions Korra that Amon is baiting them, but the situation gives them no other option. Mako fires lightning at Amon, forcing him away from the airbenders. Using firebending to give them supporting force, Mako and Korra run on the face of the adjacent wall and land on the stage, hurling fire blasts to further push Amon and his forces back. Korra releases Tenzin while asking him if he knows the location of Pema, Rohan, or Lin Beifong. Tenzin replies that he knows where Pema and the baby are imprisoned, but is clueless as to Lin's whereabouts. Freed, Tenzin rushes to the front of the battle and airbends gales of wind, knocking the remaining Equalist guards off the stage, and finally Amon who had been evading incoming fire and air. As the fighting continues, Korra releases the three kids and they escape into a backstage corridor."

Katara emerges and laments that she has tried everything she could, but she cannot restore Korra's bending. Beifong pleads with Katara to keep trying, but Katara says there is nothing more she can do. Korra can still airbend, but her connection to the other elements has been severed. Korra emerges into a roomful of people who look at her with sorrow. Tenzin tries to comfort Korra telling by her it is going to be all right, but Korra incredulously insists it will not. With her connection to the other three elements severed, Korra feels she is nothing more than an airbender, hardly worthy of the title of Avatar. Feeling that the most important piece of her life has been destroyed, she grabs her coat, leaves the room and goes outside."
