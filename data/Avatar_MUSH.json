Players used command prompts and text to explain their actions to the other players present in the same location. Cooperative social story telling was strongly encouraged; however, an elemental bending combat system existed for resolution of differences between players. Generally, most combat occurred during chapter events in which player characters acted as the protagonists against threats and challenges generated by the project team. Success or failure in these events was determined by a dice roll modified by each player character's customizable build. Players improved on their build by earning rewards points through participation in chapter events and from votes for exceptional story telling by other players.",
