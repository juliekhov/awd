When Meelo tells him he intends to take the animals back with him, Jobal brandishes a flaming fist at him. He tells Meelo the animals have been living with him since the evacuation; he ignored the evacuation order and took in the lost pets afterward. His insistence on keeping the pets with him vanishes, however, when Meelo shows him the pictures of the pets with their former families. As Jobal says his goodbyes to each of the pets, Meelo asks him to come with him to the refugee camp, offering him food, a place to stay, and company, as well as a bath, which he sorely needs according to Meelo. Agreeing on all counts, Jobal leaves with Meelo and the pets."
