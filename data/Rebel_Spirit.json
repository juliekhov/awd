As she jumps down from the plane, she happily announces to a Future Industries employee that the modifications she made to the planes have made them suitable for shipment. The man has less good news, as he tells her that, due to Hiroshi's participation in the Anti-bending Revolution, no one wants anything to do with Future Industries, putting the company on the verge of bankruptcy. Asami waves away the concern, stating she is aware of the problem and has a plan to fix it: she will go to the South Pole to meet someone who could revive their ailing company. However, as she walks away from the man, the confident look on her face falters and is replaced by one of worry."
