While in the middle of attempting to impress an audience with what he believed to be a levitation trick, Bolin and Asami entered his yacht, and Bolin noted that Varrick was not levitating, to the shock of the people surrounding the billionaire much to Asami's embarrassment. Though he seemed angry for a moment, Varrick quickly became grateful that Bolin had pointed it out and fired his swami for tricking him into believing he was levitating. He quickly took a liking to the young earthbender and showed him a moving picture of an ostrich horse. He subsequently brought out the show girl Ginger to strike poses, because he believed moving pictures to be old news. Asami tried getting Varrick's attention to remind him of their business arrangement. Varrick soon entered into a brief but tense stare-down with Asami before agreeing to finalize the details of their agreement. He took his guests on a rocket-boat ride."

When UnaVaatu was on the verge of corrupting Bolin's spirit, his strong \"spiritual mojo\" had attracted the queen of the fairies, who aided him to turn his enemy into \"magic dust\", with which he created the stars in the sky. As Varrick quickly ended the story, making Bolin turn into a dragon, go into the Spirit World, and save the Avatar, he received a standing ovation from the fugitives, much to Bolin's shock. He grew slightly annoyed when Bolin started to point out the plot holes in the script, such as the discarded storyline of \"zombie Amon\", though happily told his friend to never let the truth get in the way of a good story."

While Bolin acted as the official during their ceremony, Varrick snapped at one of his cameramen to focus on him because it was his big day, as opposed to randomly filming the audience, and gave Bolin a skeptical look when the earthbender described his bond with Zhu Li as the \"longest of long shots\". His demeanor swiftly changed, however, when Bolin asked him if he, \"Sir Iknik Blackstone Varrick of the Southern Water Tribe, master of the high seas\", would take the Lady Zhu Li Moon as his lawfully wedded wife and treat her as his honored and cherished partner, to which he excitedly answered positively. In his own vows, Varrick had described a list of tasks that Zhu Li would have to perform, scrubbing his calluses on a bi-weekly basis being one of them, which Bolin refused to read. When Zhu Li accepted nonetheless and Bolin announced that they could \"do the thing\", Varrick was dipped by his wife so she could kiss him. As the couple turned to the now applauding audience, Varrick started to cry out of happiness. Wiping his tears, he took a remote out of his pocket and, together with Zhu Li, he flipped the switch, setting off a firework display."
