Combustion Man intercepted the message and later attacked Team Avatar. The members of Team Avatar failed to land a blow on him despite their efforts, so Aang ran away to give the others a chance to escape. Aang hid behind basalt columns to trick Combustion Man, but was eventually spotted and hit by a surge of combustion. He escaped Combustion Man's fatal attacks with the use of airbending and went to hide by earthbending small rocks over him. Combustion Man once more found him, but Aang escaped by quickly jumping into the air with an earth shield. He subsequently blasted himself onto Appa and flew away safely."

Much to their surprise, they instead came across Azula. They demanded that she tells them where the Fire Lord was, telling her that she was in no position to refuse, as the eclipse took away her firebending. She refused and Toph trapped her in an earth cone. Appearing to have broken out of the detainment, Azula informed them that she had brought back some souvenirs from Ba Sing Se - two Dai Li agents. Team Avatar chased Azula through the bunker, but, surprisingly, Azula proved an even foe even without her firebending. Throughout the battle, she used her acrobatic skills to dodge all of Team Avatar's attacks."

While escaping, they soon found Azula and Ty Lee in hot pursuit of them. Ty Lee ran across the cable and onto the gondola, while Azula propelled herself onto the vehicle with firebending. Zuko and Sokka prepared to fight Azula, while Suki faced off against Ty Lee. Zuko and Sokka tried their best to defeat Azula, but she proved an even foe, with flames hurtling both ways. Ty Lee and Suki also battled evenly. The fight soon ended, however, when the warden told his guards to cut the line. Azula and Ty Lee made their way onto another gondola, leaving the five escapees and the warden to boil to death in the lake's scalding waters."
