Landing, the boy, whose name is Teo, is revealed to be paraplegic; when Sokka excitedly compliments him on his glider, Teo responds, \"You think this is good, wait until you see the other stuff my dad designed.\"",

Initially, they appear to be airbenders, but Aang, looking closer, realizes to his disappointment that they are not airbenders, stating that he could tell that by the way they moved without spirit. His suspicions are confirmed by the appearance of a boy sitting in a glider; eager to prove himself to the glider-bound kid, Aang takes off on his own glider. Appa becomes swarmed by a mob of airborne children and Sokka directs the bison to land in the temple courtyard. Aang and the child on the glider engage in a sort of talent contest: Aang airbends himself across the side of a wall on an air scooter as his glider flies alongside him and the other kid, in response, uses a canister of smoke on his glider to create an image of Aang's face, its expression irked, in the sky, to which the watching crowd enthusiastically applauds. Landing, the boy, whose name is Teo, is revealed to be paraplegic; when Sokka excitedly compliments him on his glider, Teo responds, \"You think this is good, wait until you see the other stuff my dad designed.\""
