They go into a bar-like establishment where an employee prepares a mango. The customer being served accidentally bumps into Aang, spilling some of his drink onto him. Aang uses his airbending to dry himself. The customer, excited to meet an airbender, introduces himself as Professor Zei of Ba Sing Se University. He begins quizzing Aang as though the latter is a science specimen. Sokka inquires as to whether the professor has a more recent map, and the professor unrolls a map showing a vast desert with routes marked where he has gone in search of a Knowledge Spirit's library. With the possibility that the library may have information to be used against the Fire Nation, Sokka dramatically announces his choice of location for the next mini-vacation to be the library. The professor states it is impossible to cross the desert on foot, but the gang introduces him to Appa. Sandbenders, earthbenders who specialize in bending sand, are attempting to steal Appa as the team walks out of the cantina, but the professor shoos them away."
