Beneath the earth, Katara tells Satoru to give the last of the water to Toph; if she fails, there would be no point in giving it to anyone else. After drinking the water, Toph asks Satoru to stay with her to talk. He correctly surmises that she ran away from home and tries to connect to her by telling her his past. After his parents joined the New Ozai Society, Satoru ran away to Ba Sing Se. He spent months on the streets before his uncle found him and took him in. Satoru realizes that Toph was right in calling him a \"snivelling flunky\" and, ignoring her claim otherwise, praises her."

The warrior advises him to outthink his foe, something he does all the time. Proving his point, he uses his boomerang to knock Vachir's bow and arrow out of hands and taunts him over his lack of hand-to-hand combat skills. When the Rough Rhino tries to throw a punch, Sokka grabs his fist and flips him over, throwing him to the ground. Satoru runs to his forklift and smacks its engine with the battle club, throwing the buttons back at Kahchi, who is hit and also falls to the ground. Satoru subsequently asks if the strategy applies to bigger enemies; when asked how big, he points to Old Iron, who has entirely emerged from the water."
