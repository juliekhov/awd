She was convinced, however, when Aang explained that Bumi was a friend as well as an earthbending teacher. The team found their way into the city by traveling through a sewer; they emerged from the pipes unharmed, except for Sokka, who had several purple pentapuses stuck to his face. They turned out to be harmless and Aang removed them easily. Suddenly, they were discovered by two Fire Nation soldiers who questioned why they were out past curfew. Aang quickly covered his arrow tattoo with a piece of cloth as Katara stated they were just on their way home and the soldiers decided to let them go. Just as they began leaving, however, the soldiers noticed the marks left by the pentapuses and grew suspicious, interrogating the group as to how Sokka received the markings. Katara quickly claimed that Sokka had \"pentapox\", a very contagious disease. The soldiers ran away in fear, thereby allowing the group to avoid capture."

However, the final decision of the group was to go to the Misty Palms Oasis, Katara's chosen vacation site. There they met Professor Zei, who told them he was searching for a legendary library said to be in the middle of the Si Wong Desert; the library, said to have been created by the Spirit of Knowledge and his fox servants, held more valuable tomes than any other place in the world. Sokka, believing he may be able to get information on the Fire Nation there, dedicated his \"vacation\" to finding this library."

Aang went on to explain the various events going on of which the Earth King was unaware: a war outside Ba Sing Se's walls, Long Feng and the Dai Li's conspiracy, the imprisonment of Appa, and the brainwashing of Jet and countless other individuals. The king, under the influence of Long Feng's deceitful lies, remained convinced there was no war and doubted their claims. After several attempts to convince the king, they finally decided to show the Earth King the Outer Wall, which had been earlier penetrated by the Fire Nation's drill. The king refused at first, but Sokka quickly convinced him to continue the investigation by letting him ride on Appa."
