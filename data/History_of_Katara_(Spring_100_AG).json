She was convinced, however, when Aang explained that Bumi was a friend as well as an earthbending teacher. The team found their way into the city by traveling through a sewer; they emerged from the pipes unharmed, except for Sokka, who had several purple pentapuses stuck to his face. They turned out to be harmless and Aang removed them easily. Suddenly, they were discovered by two Fire Nation soldiers who questioned why they were out past curfew. Aang quickly covered his arrow tattoo with a piece of cloth as Katara stated they were just on their way home and the soldiers decided to let them go. Just as they began leaving, however, the soldiers noticed the marks left by the pentapuses and grew suspicious, interrogating the group as to how Sokka received the markings. Katara quickly claimed that Sokka had \"pentapox\", a very contagious disease. The soldiers ran away in fear, thereby allowing the group to avoid capture."

However, the final decision of the group was to go to the Misty Palms Oasis, Katara's chosen vacation site. There they met Professor Zei, who told them he was searching for a legendary library said to be in the middle of the Si Wong Desert; the library, said to have been created by the Spirit of Knowledge and his fox servants, held more valuable tomes than any other place in the world. Sokka, believing he may be able to get information on the Fire Nation there, dedicated his \"vacation\" to finding this library."

Sokka developed a plan to take the drill down by hitting its main pressure points which turned out to be large metal braces connecting the two main parts of the drill. The team, except Toph who decided to stay in a place where she could \"see\", entered the drill. Aang and Katara used waterbending to slice through the braces and weaken them; it was decided that Aang would go to the top of the drill and deliver a final blow that would destroy the drill completely. However, midway through their sabotage, Azula and her friends discovered them and attacked. The group split up with Aang going to the top of the drill and Katara and Sokka escaping by traveling down a slurry pipeline. Ty Lee chased after them persistently, but Katara used waterbending to plug up the exit to the drill, trapping her. Toph soon came along and aided her in building up the pressure that would lead to the machine's downfall. Aang was able to successfully deliver the final blow which caused the drill to break down, thus, marking their victory."
