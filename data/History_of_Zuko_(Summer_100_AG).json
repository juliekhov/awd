Iroh refused saying that even if he defeated Ozai, and he was not sure that he could, history would see it as more senseless violence. Only the Avatar could honorably defeat the Fire Lord. When Zuko asked if he will take the throne and become Fire Lord after the war, Iroh said that the Fire Nation must have a new, young leader of unquestionable honor: Zuko. While Zuko at first questions whether he had unquestionable honor after he made so many mistakes, Iroh told him that it was how he had struggled to redeem himself that truly made him worthy. He told Zuko to return to the Fire Nation and fight against Azula for its fate."
