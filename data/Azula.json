She torched a doll that her uncle had sent her as a gift from the Earth Kingdom, preferring the weapon Zuko had gotten over a simple doll. Not long after this, her cousin Lu Ten was killed in battle, prompting Iroh to abandon his legendary six-hundred-day siege of Ba Sing Se, which in turn prompted Azula to call him \"a quitter and a loser\". She even showed some slight disrespect to her grandfather, as when she was told to call him \"Fire Lord Azulon\", she responded with, \"Can't we just call him grandfather? He's not exactly the powerful firebender he used to be\"."

Azula and her agents stalled Aang and his friends Sokka and Toph from finding Fire Lord Ozai before the eclipse, which itself lasted only eight minutes, allowing the Fire Nation to retaliate with full force once they regained control over their bending abilities, causing the invasion to fail. Later, Azula, accompanied by Mai and Ty Lee, head to the Boiling Rock, the top security Fire Nation prison, where Zuko has been captured in an attempt to infiltrate the prison and rescue the captured forces of the failed invasion; but Zuko, Sokka, Suki, and Sokka's father Hakoda escaped, as Mai and Ty Lee betrayed her and gave the rest of the group just enough time to escape. After having Mai and Ty Lee confined, Azula lead a platoon of Fire Nation Airships to the Western Air Temple, where she confronted Zuko. In the finale, Ozai named Azula his successor as Fire Lord; but soon afterward, Azula, because of the weight of the responsibility and losing her friends, begun to have a mental breakdown, and deposed nearly all of her servants and advisers. Before she was crowned however, Zuko and Katara interrupted the ceremony, whereupon Azula challenged Zuko to single combat in an Agni Kai. However, her attacks, while powerful, were wild, emotional and reckless while Zuko's were calm and disciplined; and when his attacks began to overpower her, Azula, in frustration and because of her fear of losing, sent a bolt of lightning toward Katara, but ended up striking down Zuko who attempted to redirect it. She was ultimately defeated by Katara who took her captive via Waterbending, thus ending her reign as Fire Lord before it even started."

She told her and Rafa's story to the team; the sibling bond they had resulted in uncertain looks from Azula and her brother. The princess cut the story short and asked about Ursa, to which Misu replied that neither she nor Rafa had seen her. As Aang prepared to cross into the Spirit World to seek out the wolf spirit, Azula walked away; when confronted by Zuko, she snapped at him, wondering if they were really going to find their mother or help \"a couple of vagrants\". Zuko said that it was Aang's duty to help people, and Azula accused the Fire Lord of not wanting to hold the throne anymore, instead traveling with Team Avatar to help people. Her focus quickly shifted toward her psychotic beliefs, and she accused Ursa of orchestrating Rafa and Misu's arrival to throw them off her trail. She prepared to shoot lightning at the siblings, warning her mother that her plans would fail."

After learning that the Mother of Faces had given Ursa a new identity as Noriko, Azula promptly took off to Hira'a with her brother and Sokka chasing after her. Barging into Noren and Noriko's house, Azula was finally able to confront her mother, demanding to know if Kiyi was supposed to be her replacement because she was such a monster. Sokka held her off temporarily, but the princess ultimately slammed Ursa to the wall and prepared a ball of fire, intent upon killing her.",

As a result of her sequestered life of royalty, she had developed a considerable amount of social ineptitude, particularly in her uncertainty of how to act around boys, and she frequently intimidated them during conversation. Even when attempting to flirt with Chan, her domineering and megalomaniacal personality manifested in a way that disconcerted him and prompted his recession. Her overly competitive nature surfaced during a kuai ball game, and she later admitted her jealousy over how much attention Ty Lee received from others. Later, Azula began to show signs of a fragile mentality. For all of her self-assurance, she was momentarily driven into rage when Mai betrayed her by helping Zuko to escape and admitted to loving him more than she feared Azula. As Azula moved to strike her down, she was in turn temporarily paralyzed by Ty Lee. After her friends were apprehended, the enraged princess ordered both of them to be locked away and \"left to rot\". While it was apparent that Azula held herself in high regard above her friends, their sudden betrayal drove her to the edge for an instant, hinting at just how unstable she would later prove to be."

      "text": "Azula was an extremely intelligent and cunning strategist. She was also a highly studious girl. Since childhood, she was well-versed in her nation's military history as she successfully recounting Fire Lord Sozin's strategy in an old battle. She planned a trap for Iroh and Zuko, which was only accidentally foiled by the captain of her ship. She immediately discerned the Avatar's plan to mislead her with a false trail. She also displayed incredible fighting prowess in learning the fighting styles of her foes, such as the sweeping wind kick ability displayed by Aang against her during the battle of the drill. She imitated it in the form of a sweeping fire kick during her battle with the Kyoshi warriors tending to Appa, utilizing that move to end her battle with Suki. With the Kyoshi warriors finally captured, Azula, Ty Lee, and Mai used their robes, stealing their identities to freely enter Ba Sing Se and the Earth King's palace, beginning her coup against the Earth King. This coup was single-handedly orchestrated by her, winning Ba Sing Se for the Fire Nation. During the Day of Black Sun, she laid a trap for Aang and his friends using Dai Li agents in the Fire Lord's throne room, ensuring that the eclipse time would be used up. She also displayed the ability to be so extremely capable of lying effectively that even Toph could not sense it regardless of how blatant the lie was, showing that Azula did not feel remorse for lying or many of her other actions. She also displayed an ability to realize whether or not someone was telling the truth, stating simply that she was a \"people person\"."
