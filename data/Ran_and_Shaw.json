Both their flames were extinguished, however, before they could be presented. The two dragons flew out of their caves when they were summoned by the Sun Warriors, and began circling Aang and Zuko. After observing their movements for a while, Aang was able to deduce that the dragons wanted them to perform the \"${link_4}\", an ancient firebending form, with them. After Aang performed this form in unison with the blue dragon and Zuko with the red one, Ran and Shaw deemed them worthy and showed them the \"true\" meaning of firebending by engulfing the duo in a colorful spiral of fire. Having passed on their knowledge, the dragons retreated to their respective lairs.",

      "text": "When Zuko lost access to his firebending, he and Aang traveled to the Sun Warriors' ancient city and discovered that the civilization, believed to have gone extinct long before their arrival, was still alive and well. The duo set out to learn the original form of firebending from the masters, Ran and Shaw. Aang and Zuko journeyed to the cave of the masters, each carrying a piece of the Eternal Flame which they would present to the masters as an offering. Both their flames were extinguished, however, before they could be presented. The two dragons flew out of their caves when they were summoned by the Sun Warriors, and began circling Aang and Zuko. After observing their movements for a while, Aang was able to deduce that the dragons wanted them to perform the \"Dancing Dragon\", an ancient firebending form, with them. After Aang performed this form in unison with the blue dragon and Zuko with the red one, Ran and Shaw deemed them worthy and showed them the \"true\" meaning of firebending by engulfing the duo in a colorful spiral of fire. Having passed on their knowledge, the dragons retreated to their respective lairs."
