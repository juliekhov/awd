They became stranded at Central City Station, however, when Kuvira attacked the metropolis and had her army destroy the train tracks. When Prince Wu arrived with two badgermoles, Yin and the other evacuees followed the creatures underground as they tunneled a way out for them. She was pleased and flattered when the royal dedicated one of his songs with which he commanded the animals to her, even though most other evacuees did not appreciate his singing. Yin looked on in surprise when Wu started singing and dancing with renewed vigor when three of Kuvira's mecha suits threatened them, which led the badgermoles to attack the soldiers and crush their machines."
