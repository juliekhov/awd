He was the first person to desert the Fire Nation military and live to tell the tale. Because of this, he came to be known as \"The Deserter\" and was regarded as a legend. He relocated to the Earth Kingdom, where he encountered a small tribe who became his travel companions. As a member of the Order of the White Lotus, he aided in the liberation of Ba Sing Se."
