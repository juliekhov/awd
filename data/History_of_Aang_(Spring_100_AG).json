Although Katara believed it was time for Aang to find a different earthbending teacher, Aang explained that Bumi was not just an earthbending teacher but a friend. Aang, Sokka, and Katara infiltrated the city via a sewer. Upon emerging, Sokka found several creatures called purple pentapuses stuck to his face; they turned out to be harmless, and Aang removed them. Moments later, they encountered three Fire Nation soldiers who questioned why they were out past curfew. Aang quickly covered his arrow tattoo with a piece of cloth and Katara said that they were just on their way home. The soldiers decided to let them go until they noticed the marks on Sokka left by the pentapuses, raising their suspicion. Katara quickly fabricated an explanation, claiming him to have \"pentapox\", a very contagious disease. The soldiers ran away in fear, thus the team avoided capture."

Kenji, the zookeeper, told Aang that the zoo no longer received funding from the Dai Li because it was not popular with the children. However, in a circle of troubles, nobody came to the zoo because it did not receive the funding and was quite filthy; one of the cages showed an animal lying near multiple piles of feces. Kenji expressed his desire to let his animals run freely in open spaces. Aang suggested moving the animals to an open area just outside the city."

He urged Zuko to choose to aid the Avatar. However, a mass of crystals suddenly entrapped Iroh, and Azula arrived on scene. She said that she expected this sort of treachery from Iroh, but not from her brother. She began to feed him tales of how this was the most glorious day in Fire Nation history, and that if he joined her, Zuko would regain his father's love and honor. Iroh begged Zuko not listen to Azula, telling him that the kind of redemption Azula was offering was not the redemption for him, but Azula continued to plot, telling Zuko how she had planned everything and that they would only win if he joined her. Iroh begged even more for Zuko to look deep inside his heart and see what he truly wanted. Azula sent the Dai Li away and told Zuko that he could choose whatever he wanted, and she walked away; leaving him to ponder the two sides of the coin.",
