Soon after, they travel to the ${link_4}, the largest ${link_5} in the entire ${link_6}. While Katara expresses awe at seeing the yawning chasm before them, Sokka is bored by the sight, viewing it as somewhat lackluster, and expresses his intent to fly over it on ${link_7}. Before they can leave, however, a ${link_8} runs up to them and warns them not to leave with a ${link_9} to cross the canyon because he was there first. The man angrily says to the ${link_10} that he is holding a spot for the rest of his tribe, the ${link_11}, until they arrive. While waiting, the ${link_12} tribe arrives, whom the man claims has been an enemy of his tribe for a hundred years. The two tribes' differences are immediately visible: while the Gan Jin tribe appears neat, well-mannered, and clean, dressed in clothes of white fabric, the Zhang tribe seems dirty and primitive, dressed in garments made from animal skins. The ${link_13} canyon guide subsequently arrives, prompting both tribes to begin arguing over which should be escorted first: the Zhangs claim that some of their members are sick, while the Gan Jins assert that their elderly are weary from their travel. As the two tribes bicker, Katara wonders if Aang is ready to test his role as a mediator. Despite Aang's reservations about his possible success, Katara alerts the tribes of Aang's status as the Avatar, giving him the chance to propose that they all travel together. When the tribes dismiss the suggestion and resume their argument, Aang ends the verbal fight by shouting over the chaos that Appa will carry their sick and elderly while the two tribes cross the canyon together, conditions to which both tribes agree.",

      "text": "Katara and Sokka are arguing over how to set up their campsite, with Aang ending the fight and gloating about his ability to solve problems as the Avatar. Soon after, they travel to the Great Divide, the largest canyon in the entire world. While Katara expresses awe at seeing the yawning chasm before them, Sokka is bored by the sight, viewing it as somewhat lackluster, and expresses his intent to fly over it on Appa. Before they can leave, however, a man runs up to them and warns them not to leave with a guide to cross the canyon because he was there first. The man angrily says to the team that he is holding a spot for the rest of his tribe, the Gan Jin, until they arrive. While waiting, the Zhang tribe arrives, whom the man claims has been an enemy of his tribe for a hundred years. The two tribes' differences are immediately visible: while the Gan Jin tribe appears neat, well-mannered, and clean, dressed in clothes of white fabric, the Zhang tribe seems dirty and primitive, dressed in garments made from animal skins. The earthbending canyon guide subsequently arrives, prompting both tribes to begin arguing over which should be escorted first: the Zhangs claim that some of their members are sick, while the Gan Jins assert that their elderly are weary from their travel. As the two tribes bicker, Katara wonders if Aang is ready to test his role as a mediator. Despite Aang's reservations about his possible success, Katara alerts the tribes of Aang's status as the Avatar, giving him the chance to propose that they all travel together. When the tribes dismiss the suggestion and resume their argument, Aang ends the verbal fight by shouting over the chaos that Appa will carry their sick and elderly while the two tribes cross the canyon together, conditions to which both tribes agree."
