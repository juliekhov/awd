      "text": "With Zaheer incarcerated once more and the other three known members deceased, the Red Lotus' insurrection had been brought to an end. However, it had caused the Earth Kingdom to descend into a state of anarchy due to the loss of a central power, and the Avatar was left weakened from the poison and would stay out of commission until 174 AG. In response, Tenzin decided that the Air Nation would follow Korra's selfless example and help keep balance in the world. Though the Red Lotus was seen as heroes by some Ba Sing Se citizens, President Raiko declared them to be terrorists in the eyes of the United Republic of Nations. Despite being aware of a possible resurgence due to Red Lotus members still being at large, the world leaders dedicated their efforts to improving the Earth Kingdom's future. In that regard, Kuvira was appointed as the Earth Kingdom's interim president and attempted to reunite the nation with her army, though her actions eventually led to the formation of the Earth Empire."
