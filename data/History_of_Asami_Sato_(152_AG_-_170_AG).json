When Korra came to visit the next day, Asami took her and the brothers to the racetrack where Future Industries test-drives its new Satomobiles. Noticing Korra's interest, she invited the Avatar to take a drive with her. Since Korra did not know how to drive one, she sat behind Asami and together they raced one of the test drivers. After driving in second place nearly the entire course, Asami managed to pass the other driver and win the race. When Asami told Korra that people should not be afraid to mix it up sometimes, Korra apologized for having judged her so quickly. Asami did not mind, as the majority of people thought of her as a helpless rich girl when she was actually quite capable of taking good care of herself, being a competitive driver and an expert in self-defense techniques."
