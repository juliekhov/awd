When Toph refused to bow for the statue, which was the first part of the ceremony, and insulted the holiday, Aang taught Yee-Li and the other Acolytes that a true Air Nomad lets insults pass them by in order to preserve inner peace. Yee-Li did partake in the bowing ceremony and her excitement for the holiday's celebration only grew after that, exclaiming it to already be incredible. For the next step, she took out her cymbals and joined Aang in creating traditional Air Nomad music to accompany the group's walk toward a sacred meadow where they were set to enjoy a ceremonial meal. However, her musical input aggravated Toph, who eventually used her metalbending to destroy the instrument."
