      "text": "A large underground wrestling stadium, known as Earth Rumble VI, is owned by its host, Xin Fu. It consists of a large rectangular stone platform on which earthbenders battle. Surrounding this are rows of seats in which spectators may sit; however, many seating areas are dangerous as occasionally rocks are hurled into the audience. The rest of the stadium is lit with glowing green gemstones hanging on the ceiling. Residents pay admission to see powerful earthbending masters fight in a ring for the title of champion."
