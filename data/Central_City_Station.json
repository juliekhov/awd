A last group of evacuees became stranded in the station after the train tracks were destroyed by the military of the Earth Empire. It sustained further damage when Tu and Prince Wu each brought a badgermole into the building and the royal ordered the animals to start digging a tunnel. With their earthbending, the creatures raised the ground underneath some of the tracks, causing them to bend and break."
