After Katara swiftly defeats her opponent by encasing him in a tall ice formation, Master Pakku unceremoniously releases the student and asks the other students if any of them feel up to sparring a second time with Katara. Hearing no response from his already-beaten students, Master Pakku tells Katara that she has progressed faster than any of the others, and that her hard work and determination have paid off in ways that raw talent alone cannot do. Seeing Aang playing with Momo, Master Pakku cynically asks Aang if he wishes to face Katara, since he must have mastered waterbending already if he is playing with \"house pets\". Unconcerned by Pakku's tone, Aang responds that he would not consider himself a \"master\" but has something to show Pakku regardless and proceeds to bend snow around himself as if he were a snowman. This does not impress either Master Pakku or Katara."
