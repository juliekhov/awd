Quicksand and cracked ice respectively pull Aang beneath the earth and below the waters causing him to lose the quest. Aang cannot pass through bodies of water. Afterward, there are also patches of hot lava, which engulf Aang and result in the same outcome as the cracked ice and quicksand. In some cases barrels and boxes can obstruct Aang's path and cause the player to slowly run out of time while trying to traverse them, with the barrels and boxes acting as obstacles. There are likely a few more such obstacles as well."
