She offered to tutor Katara in order to carry on the tradition of the Southern waterbenders to which the young waterbender happily agreed, wanting to learn more about her tribe's cultural heritage. The next day, Hama personally trained Katara and explained to her that water can be found in unexpected places. She demonstrated to her several useful techniques including the manipulation of water vapor and the ambient channeling of water from fire lilies, flowers native to the Fire Nation. She told Katara of one more technique she had to teach, one that could only be utilized under the full moon. When Katara expressed hesitance due to rumors of the disappearances, Hama reassured her, stating that two master waterbenders beneath a full moon should be able to handle anything."

Horrified by the idea of controlling another person's body, Katara refused to learn bloodbending. This led Katara to realize that Hama had been causing the villagers to disappear, but Hama angrily stated that the people of the Fire Nation deserve the same treatment that they gave to the Southern waterbenders.

She revealed the team's plan to wait until after Sozin's Comet to battle the Fire Lord. Dismayed, Zuko revealed Ozai's plan to burn the Earth Kingdom down with enhanced firebending and warned Aang that he needed to defeat the Fire Lord before the comet arrived if he still wanted there to be a world to save. The following day, the group discovered that Aang and Momo were missing and searched the entire island. Their mission turned up unsuccessful, so they turned to Zuko, who had experience in tracking Aang down. The group flew to the Earth Kingdom, where Zuko asked June to track Aang down using the scent of his glider. When her shirshu was unable to do so, he instead asked that she found Iroh, offering one of his smelly sandals for guidance. June tracked him down to Ba Sing Se and left. During the evening, the group was approached by members of the Order of the White Lotus, namely Pakku, who revealed himself to be Katara and Sokka's step-grandfather, having married Kanna. Alongside him were other White Lotus masters the group had met before: Bumi, Jeong Jeong, and Piandao. They took them to the Order's campsite, where they met Iroh. It was later decided that Katara would return to the Fire Nation to help Zuko usurp the throne from Azula when Ozai was defeated."
