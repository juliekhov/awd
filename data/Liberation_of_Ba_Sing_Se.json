Through her expert manipulation, Azula was able to secure control over the Dai Li, the power-hungry cultural enforcers of Ba Sing Se. She was also able to enlist the help of her exiled brother Prince Zuko, who was desperate to return to the Fire Nation. Together, they overthrew Earth King Kuei and defeated Avatar Aang in a coup d'\u00e9tat that left Azula in total control of the city, denying the country the resources necessary to win the War. Within days, the Dai Li demolished the city walls and the Fire Nation Army conquered the city, securing almost total victory over the Earth Kingdom."
