Aang, in his room, is surprised by the sudden appearance of Toph; as Aang jumps into a defensive stance, she calls a truce. The two of them walk the grounds of her family's estate while she explains to him how she sees using earthbending. Toph envies Aang's carefree life, but knows she has commitments to her family that prevent her from leaving to join him. Suddenly, the two of them are ambushed by Xin Fu and his wrestlers: The Boulder, The Hippo, Fire Nation Man, The Gopher, The Gecko, and the Headhunter. A ransom note is left demanding five hundred gold pieces for the safe return of their daughter. Toph's father enlists Master Yu's help, and Sokka and Katara come along as well."

Her father protests, saying Toph is blind, tiny, helpless and fragile, which causes Toph to reject her father and assist them. Toph heads back into the arena demanding Aang's release. The earthbenders begin to attack, and Toph tells Sokka and Katara to leave them to her. Toph defeats each opponent almost effortlessly, which amazes and shocks Lao and Master Yu. Finally, Toph faces off against Xin Fu and sends him flying into the wall, prompting Master Yu to declare her to be \"the greatest earthbender [he has] ever seen!\"",

During the Cold War, many of these \"bad guys\" were supposedly from Russia, but were actually Americans putting on accents. Fire Nation Man's accent was notably Russian.\n Sokka's behavior during the match is a reference to the stereotypical pro wrestling fan.\n Katara commenting, \"This is just going to be a bunch of guys chucking rocks at each other\", parallels the stereotypical friend who is forced to go to a sporting match.\n The Earth Rumble Championship Belt is similar to the WWE Championship Belt.\n The raised fist logo for Earth Rumble VI, while very similar to a Socialist emblem, is also a more subtle reference to the steel fist that used to be the iconic piece in the stage set of WWE SmackDown for a number of years.",

      "text": "Earth Rumble VI is a parody of professional wrestling match called the Royal Rumble and includes parodies of many professional wrestlers and wrestling conventions. References include:\n The Boulder can be assumed to refer to Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, since he is dark-skinned and refers to himself in the third person; ironically, he is voiced by Mick \"Mankind\" Foley, one of the Rock's biggest rivals and closest friends in wrestling.\n In the Avatar Extras, it was said that the show's creators tried to get the former wrestler to be The Boulder, though the exact details were not explained.\n\n Fire Nation Man is a reference to wrestling's tradition of ersatz \"bad guys\" (referred to in professional wrestling slang as \"Heels\"). During the Cold War, many of these \"bad guys\" were supposedly from Russia, but were actually Americans putting on accents. Fire Nation Man's accent was notably Russian.\n Sokka's behavior during the match is a reference to the stereotypical pro wrestling fan.\n Katara commenting, \"This is just going to be a bunch of guys chucking rocks at each other\", parallels the stereotypical friend who is forced to go to a sporting match.\n The Earth Rumble Championship Belt is similar to the WWE Championship Belt.\n The raised fist logo for Earth Rumble VI, while very similar to a Socialist emblem, is also a more subtle reference to the steel fist that used to be the iconic piece in the stage set of WWE SmackDown for a number of years."
