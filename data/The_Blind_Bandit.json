He is flanked by all the wrestlers, who threaten them as they leave. Katara runs after Toph as she leaves, asking for her assistance. Her father protests, saying Toph is blind, tiny, helpless and fragile, which causes Toph to reject her father and assist them. Toph heads back into the arena demanding Aang's release. The earthbenders begin to attack, and Toph tells Sokka and Katara to leave them to her. Toph defeats each opponent almost effortlessly, which amazes and shocks Lao and Master Yu. Finally, Toph faces off against Xin Fu and sends him flying into the wall, prompting Master Yu to declare her to be \"the greatest earthbender [he has] ever seen!\""
