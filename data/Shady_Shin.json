During the Equalists' assembly, he still grinned, strained against his captors, and acted strong to raise the morale of the other desperate benders, proving to have a strong will despite the hopeless situation.

This is also evidenced by his hateful look toward Amon when the Equalist leader took Zolt's bending."
