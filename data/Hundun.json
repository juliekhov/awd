      "text": "Around 830 BG, Hundun and his conjoined twin were kings in the physical world, having mastered the Chaotic Attack and gathered an immense treasure. Eventually, they were confronted by an incarnation of the Avatar who badly injured Hundun's brother, forcing the two to escape into the Spirit World to save their life. Hundun's brother was unable to recover, however, and Hundun was completely consumed by his hatred for the Avatar. The idea to exert revenge on the Avatar became his sole purpose of living and he began to seek a way to heal his twin brother. After spending centuries searching for the secret of immortality, Hundun discovered a way to make himself whole again; he had to kill an Avatar by extracting their chi, which would grant him vengeance as well. Despite this, Hundun was unable to leave the Spirit World as the spirit portals were still closed."
