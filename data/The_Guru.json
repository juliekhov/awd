They discover a massive hole has been created in the back of Toph's prison, which is empty. Toph emerges from several feet away and uses earthbending to thrust Xin Fu and Yu into the chamber. After taking a few moments to bask in her triumph and state her status as \"the greatest earthbender\", Toph rapidly journeys toward Ba Sing Se by surfing along a self-made wave of earth. This leaves Xin Fu and Yu locked very uncomfortably within the coffin, with Xin Fu frustrated as ever at having to spend time with his companion.",
