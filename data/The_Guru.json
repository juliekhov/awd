General How says that General Fong's fortress will be the staging point of the attack where they will send in troops, demonstrating the motion by earthbending several stone pieces representing Earth Kingdom forces across a world map. Momo suddenly darts across the board and knocks the pillars over. Katara laughs at the lemur's actions and attempts to joke with the five generals, who are not amused. General How asks Katara to deliver a scroll detailing the invasion plans so that it may receive the seal of the Earth King, which will finalize the plan."

      "text": "The argument continues back at the Eastern Air Temple, with Pathik telling Aang he must open all the chakras to master the Avatar State. Aang decides to try and do so, and he begins to visualize an image of Katara disappearing into space and himself being taken high above the planet to walk along a purple stream of cosmic energy. The stream is radiating from a gigantic image of himself in the Avatar State, which surrounds him in a sphere of energy radiating from its palms. Aang is suddenly surprised, however, when an image of Katara, captured underground, appears behind him. He abandons the Avatar State-induced figure and begins running toward the image, causing the stream of cosmic energy to dissipate, and Aang to plummet to the Earth. Jolting awake from his meditation, Aang desperately says that Katara is in trouble and he must go back to Ba Sing Se to aid her. Pathik tries to stop him, telling him that by choosing attachment, the last chakra has become blocked and if he leaves now, he will not be able trigger the Avatar State at all. Aang hesitates, but continues on without looking back or responding, to Pathik's dismay."
