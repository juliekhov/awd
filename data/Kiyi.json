Kiyi told him that the toy was also named Kiyi as she thought it was \"such a good name\". When Zuko commented on the doll's haircut, Kiyi told him that she had tried to make the doll prettier, but accidentally cut too much of its hair off. Zuko responded that Azula used to do things like that to her own dolls as a little girl, prompting Azula to clarify that she cut off their heads, rather than their hair. After she was asked whether she wanted to see a demonstration, Kiyi refused and went behind Zuko in fear\u00a0while hugging her doll tightly to herself. Shortly thereafter, Kiyi explained to her father that she was trying to be hospitable to their guests after he entered with ${link_2}.

She asked them if they wanted to see her doll, a suggestion which was met by Azula's refusal while Zuko happily accepted. Kiyi told him that the toy was also named Kiyi as she thought it was \"such a good name\". When Zuko commented on the doll's haircut, Kiyi told him that she had tried to make the doll prettier, but accidentally cut too much of its hair off. Zuko responded that Azula used to do things like that to her own dolls as a little girl, prompting Azula to clarify that she cut off their heads, rather than their hair. After she was asked whether she wanted to see a demonstration, Kiyi refused and went behind Zuko in fear\u00a0while hugging her doll tightly to herself. Shortly thereafter, Kiyi explained to her father that she was trying to be hospitable to their guests after he entered with Sokka. When Team Avatar left\u00a0her family's home, Kiyi ran up to Zuko\u00a0and\u00a0begged\u00a0him to come back some time again."
