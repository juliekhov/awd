After pulling hard on the reins and being thrown to the ground by their tensile force, Katara and Sokka, as well as a group of villagers from ${link_8}, stop him, believing that a trip to the temple is not necessary. Aang adamantly states that Avatar Roku can tell him the meaning of his vision of a comet and that this is the only way to learn its meaning. Eventually, the siblings decide to let Aang go, on the condition that they accompany him. The ${link_9} gives Aang a few supplies and tells him that, since it is a long way to Avatar ${link_10}'s temple, if they want to get there before the ${link_11} is over, they must leave immediately. When Aang tries to thank him for his kindness, the leader cuts him off mid-sentence, yelling at him to leave that instant; Aang does so. Later in the day, there is a knock at the door of the leader's house; he opens it to find ${link_12} ${link_13} before him. Zuko forces the man back through his door, demanding to know where the Avatar went.",

Aang tries to tell Appa that Katara and Sokka are not going with them, as he does not wish to endanger his friends' lives. The Avatar intends to make the journey to the temple alone. After pulling hard on the reins and being thrown to the ground by their tensile force, Katara and Sokka, as well as a group of villagers from Senlin Village, stop him, believing that a trip to the temple is not necessary. Aang adamantly states that Avatar Roku can tell him the meaning of his vision of a comet and that this is the only way to learn its meaning. Eventually, the siblings decide to let Aang go, on the condition that they accompany him. The village leader gives Aang a few supplies and tells him that, since it is a long way to Avatar Roku's temple, if they want to get there before the solstice is over, they must leave immediately. When Aang tries to thank him for his kindness, the leader cuts him off mid-sentence, yelling at him to leave that instant; Aang does so. Later in the day, there is a knock at the door of the leader's house; he opens it to find Prince Zuko before him. Zuko forces the man back through his door, demanding to know where the Avatar went."

He goes on to say that when Avatar Roku died, the other sages, including his grandfather, waited for the new Avatar to appear, though that never happened. When Fire Lord Sozin started the Hundred Year War, he forced the sages to serve him; only Shyu's family remained loyal to the Avatar. He explains that when the sages found out Aang was alive, Shyu knew that he would have to betray the others in order to help Aang. They eventually arrive on a higher level of the temple, where a huge door is located. Shyu tells them that it must have recently been closed and that only a fully realized Avatar or five fire blasts from five different firebenders can open it. None of them know how to open the door, but Sokka begins to formulate a plan."

However, both when he first stands directly in front of the sanctuary's doors and when they all fire after the doors open, he has four guards on either side, even though right before they fire, there are three on either side again. There are also more guards behind him during the attack. It can be determined the firebenders standing beside and behind Zhao are his guards because the other four Fire Sages are behind the ones attacking and watching from a different spot."
