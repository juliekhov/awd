Sokka later teased Katara about her having kissed Jet. Despite all this, Katara was eventually able to set her anger aside after coming to the conclusion that Jet had changed his ways. Jet was fatally wounded by Long Feng and the team was forced to leave him and his freedom fighters behind. Katara was shown to be deeply remorseful when the group left Lake Laogai, somehow knowing that Jet would not make it. Jet later succumbed to his wounds."
