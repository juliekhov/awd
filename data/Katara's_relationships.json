When the two arrived, Azula challenged Zuko to an Agni Kai; Zuko accepted the challenge, explaining to Katara that he felt victory was feasible as Azula was noticeably \"slipping\". During the duel Azula fired a bolt of lightning at Katara, and Zuko rushed to her aid, becoming critically wounded after a botched attempt at lightning redirection. This forced Katara to fight Azula on her own. After disarming the princess, she immediately ran over to heal Zuko and voiced her gratefulness for saving her life, and vice versa. The two remained friends after the Hundred Year War."
