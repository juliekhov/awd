Recalling his discovery of the level filled with funhouse mirrors and the ${link_12} deck, he muses that he misses Varrick, as the businessman knew how to make things interesting. He asks Mako if he has told Korra the truth about the severity of their argument and that he sort of began dating Asami in her absence. Mako tries to explain that he is \"waiting for the right moment\", but Bolin, quoting his brother, tells him to get it over with quickly, like \"ripping off a bloodsucking leech\". At that moment, Korra emphasizes her drive to close the ${link_13} and defeat ${link_14} and ${link_15} by attacking the dummy with ${link_16}, decapitating it; the head tumbles through the air and lands at Mako's feet.

While they watch, Bolin joins them, wearing a coat and eating a pie. Astonished by the attributes, Mako asks his brother where he got them. Bolin amusedly points out that they are on Varrick's ship, so they could find anything. Recalling his discovery of the level filled with funhouse mirrors and the catgator deck, he muses that he misses Varrick, as the businessman knew how to make things interesting. He asks Mako if he has told Korra the truth about the severity of their argument and that he sort of began dating Asami in her absence. Mako tries to explain that he is \"waiting for the right moment\", but Bolin, quoting his brother, tells him to get it over with quickly, like \"ripping off a bloodsucking leech\". At that moment, Korra emphasizes her drive to close the spirit portals and defeat Unalaq and Vaatu by attacking the dummy with firebending, decapitating it; the head tumbles through the air and lands at Mako's feet. Mako, suddenly fearful, decides against telling Korra, to Bolin's amusement."
