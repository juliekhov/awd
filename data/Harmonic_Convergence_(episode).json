Recalling his discovery of the level filled with funhouse mirrors and the ${link_12} deck, he muses that he misses Varrick, as the businessman knew how to make things interesting. He asks Mako if he has told Korra the truth about the severity of their argument and that he sort of began dating Asami in her absence. Mako tries to explain that he is \"waiting for the right moment\", but Bolin, quoting his brother, tells him to get it over with quickly, like \"ripping off a bloodsucking leech\". At that moment, Korra emphasizes her drive to close the ${link_13} and defeat ${link_14} and ${link_15} by attacking the dummy with ${link_16}, decapitating it; the head tumbles through the air and lands at Mako's feet. Mako, suddenly fearful, decides against telling Korra, to Bolin's amusement.",

While they watch, Bolin joins them, wearing a coat and eating a pie. Astonished by the attributes, Mako asks his brother where he got them. Bolin amusedly points out that they are on Varrick's ship, so they could find anything. Recalling his discovery of the level filled with funhouse mirrors and the catgator deck, he muses that he misses Varrick, as the businessman knew how to make things interesting. He asks Mako if he has told Korra the truth about the severity of their argument and that he sort of began dating Asami in her absence. Mako tries to explain that he is \"waiting for the right moment\", but Bolin, quoting his brother, tells him to get it over with quickly, like \"ripping off a bloodsucking leech\". At that moment, Korra emphasizes her drive to close the spirit portals and defeat Unalaq and Vaatu by attacking the dummy with firebending, decapitating it; the head tumbles through the air and lands at Mako's feet. Mako, suddenly fearful, decides against telling Korra, to Bolin's amusement."

As her father apologizes for failing her, she wills him to not give up yet, as Harmonic Convergence is not there yet. At that moment, Desna and Eska throw a bound Asami, Mako, and Bolin inside the tent. Entering as well, Unalaq mockingly congratulates them on gaining \"front row seats to the beginning of the new world order\". Korra pleads with him to reconsider, as freeing Vaatu will not make him powerful but rather a traitor to \"everything good that has happened for the last ten thousand years\". Unalaq denounces her belief in the rightness of Wan's decision to separate the Spirit World from the physical, labeling it to be chaos as opposed to balance. He rejects the Avatar's role as the bridge between the worlds, expressing the belief that spirits and humans should live together as one. Korra assures Unalaq that she will force Vaatu back into his prison if he is released, just like Wan did before her. Acknowledging that the fusion between Wan and Raava tipped the scales in Raava's favor, Unalaq reveals his ultimate goal: he plans to level the playing field by fusing himself with Vaatu during Harmonic Convergence and become the new Avatar, a Dark Avatar."

He leaves and tasks Desna and Eska to make sure the captives do not escape, promising that he will be back for Korra once Harmonic Convergence is over.
