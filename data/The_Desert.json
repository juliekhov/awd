A distraught Aang verbally goes after Toph, scolding her for letting the sandbenders escape \u2013 accusing her of intentionally letting Appa be captured. Katara attempts to calm Aang down and points out that Toph saved their lives. However, Sokka states that they are still in need of rescuing, being stranded in the middle of nowhere. Aang lashes out at everyone, calling them selfish. Despite Katara's efforts to calm Aang, he heads out alone on his glider to search for a sign of Appa. Katara takes charge and decides that the rest of them need to start walking if they hope to get out of the desert and reach Ba Sing Se to inform the Earth King of the upcoming solar eclipse. As they walk away from the crater left by the sunken library, Sokka sarcastically wonders if they dig up the \"giant owl\", he would give them a ride."
