He becomes frustrated when Pakku criticizes his technique and mockingly says that this move may be too advanced, suggesting that Aang should try an easier one. After her healing class, Katara thanks Yugoda for her time, and the teacher, noticing Katara's betrothal necklace, asks her who she is marrying. Katara tells her she is not ready for marriage, and the necklace is rather a family heirloom passed from her grandmother to her mother and eventually to her. Yugoda states she recognizes the carving and tells Katara she is the spitting image of Kanna, Katara's grandmother, revealing that Kanna was her old friend. Much to the surprise of Katara, Yugoda also states that Kanna was born in the Northern Water Tribe, going on to tell her that Kanna had an arranged marriage with a young waterbender, but mysteriously left the Northern Water Tribe without saying goodbye."
