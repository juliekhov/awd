Korra, Jinora, and Opal walk out to confront Kuvira, standing with her entire army at her back; after a brief standoff, Korra realizes there is no other option than to fight, and Kuvira proposes a one-on-one duel between them. Kuvira holds the upper hand until Korra enters the Avatar State, momentarily turning the tide of the duel; her Avatar apparition once again appears before her, however, rendering Korra unable to finish the fight and enabling Kuvira to defeat her. Only when the metalbender is seconds from killing Korra do Opal and Jinora intervene and save the Avatar; they flee Zaofu, leaving Suyin, Wei, and Wing in Kuvira's custody.
