The ${link_0} lets out a relieved laugh, and compliments Varrick on his deeply convincing act, adding that even he believed Varrick was truly intending to blow them up. He subsequently asks the inventor how to disarm the bomb, to which Varrick responds that he is not lying; the bomb really is on the verge of detonating, and he cannot stop it. Terrified, Bolin frantically looks for some way to disarm the explosive. When that fails, he finds a way out, spotting a hatch leading out through the floor of the train. He walks up to Varrick, who is poetically coming to terms with his imminent death, glares at the inventor, slaps him in the face, and tells him he hates him. He proceeds to grab ahold of Varrick and jump out through the hatch, sinking them deep into the ground with earthbending mere moments before the train explodes with devastating force. Having witnessed the massive purple blast himself, Baatar Jr. is shocked to realize that Varrick was not bluffing. He declares the inventor to be \"crazier than a sewer pipe elephant rat\" and orders his men to return the train to Zaofu. Having survived the blast, Varrick and Bolin tumble through the side of the deep crater left by the bomb's detonation, coughing and gasping for air. Varrick starts to laugh, ecstatic that Bolin finally \"did the thing\", and kisses him on the forehead. Bolin simply glares at him, wondering aloud how Zhu Li was able to work for Varrick at all.",
