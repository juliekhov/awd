As he climbs onto the saddle, he finds Zuko waiting, and the firebender berates him for such a poorly thought-out plan of infiltrating the Boiling Rock prison on Appa. Sokka explains to Zuko that the invasion plan was his idea, and it failed, causing his father and many others to be captured and jailed by the Fire Nation. He informs the young prince that he intends to infiltrate the prison in which his father is held and rescue him, and to Sokka's surprise, Zuko decides to go along with him. Instead of using Appa, he suggests they use the war balloon that he stole to escape from the Fire Nation capital. The next morning, the gang finds a note written by Zuko, stating that he and Sokka had gone fishing together and reminding Aang to continue his firebending practice, much to the Avatar's annoyance."
