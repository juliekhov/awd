Zuko refuses to tell, on the grounds that knowing will only make Sokka feel worse than he already does, until Sokka states that he is concerned for what happened to Hakoda after the failed invasion. Hesitantly, Zuko answers that Hakoda would most likely be held at the Boiling Rock, a prison in the center of a volcano that is located in the ocean. Zuko is suspicious of why Sokka would ask such a thing so randomly, but the latter promises him he is not planning anything."
