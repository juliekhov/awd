Aang notes how he thinks Azula meant to leave the letter behind and did not simply drop it, contrary to Sokka's opinion. At the house, Ursa takes Zuko aside to talk to him while Noren and Kiyi sit further away. She confesses that she owes Zuko the same apology she gave to Azula, admitting her sorrow for choosing to forget her own children, but Zuko believes that he has grown up fine despite the circumstances. Before they catch up, Zuko says that he has to first know the truth about the letter, which he hands to his mother."

She is outraged at his actions, citing that he knew more than anyone that Zuko was his son. This leads Ozai to the question of why she would tell so obvious a lie, to which she replies, \"Maybe it was just my wishful thinking.\" Ozai grins wildly at this brazen remark, and declares that from that point on, he will spare no expense in treating Zuko as though he were \"the son of a treacherous dog\" only to fulfill Ursa's wish.",
