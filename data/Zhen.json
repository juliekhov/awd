Later that evening, Zhen and Asami entered an airship at the storage facility for Kuvira's weapons leftover from the invasion. The airship flew above the facility, as the rest of the Triad fought Team Avatar, and at Tokuga's call, Zhen brought Asami to an opening to the ship, holding her and threatening her with a fire dagger."
