Ming-Hua used waterbending to cut a small circle from Korra's bedroom window, which allowed Zaheer to sedate Naga. As the polar bear dog managed to growl before being paralyzed, Korra woke up but was also paralyzed. Despite the group's efforts, Pabu noticed them and alerted Bolin and Mako, who headed outside to attack the four criminals."
