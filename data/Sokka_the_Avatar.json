Kaya has taken him to meet her family with Aang in tow. Although her parents adore the fact that their daughter is dating who they think is the Avatar, Kaya's sister asks why Aang, who is wearing a fur cap to hide his airbender tattoo, is with him, to which Sokka explains that Aang is his servant. While Aang is made to sweep the house, Sokka warns Kaya not to let this information slip, \"for security reasons.\" Even so, having told a few people already, the entire town is soon at her doorstep looking for advice from the Avatar. Aang, peeved by his downgrade to servant, tells Sokka that, being the Avatar, he can handle it himself, which at first he accomplishes."
