A back view shot of the statue shows the main street of Kyoshi village with houses at both sides and one bigger house at the end of the street. Another villager is cleaning the back of the statue with a broom. The camera pans to the right until the big house becomes the center of the shot before cutting to a shot of Appa who lazily lies on his side, eating hay while two villagers are grooming him. He growls and chews while the camera pans the the left and up to focus on three open windows of the main house on the first floor. Cut to a side-view of inside the house where Aang, Katara, and Momo are sitting at a long table. A villager places another dish on the already richly filled table. Aang and Momo are very excited to see the display of decadent desserts in front of it, but Katara supports an uneasy look.",

They run out of the picture, but Aang quickly comes back and traverses the bridge again, now from left to right. The girls are still following him, screaming loudly with the same amount of enthusiasm. They run out of the picture again, but once again, Aang runs back in. He runs up the bridge, but halts in the middle, looking from left to right as he sees that hordes of fangirls are trapping him on the bridge as they run up from both sides. Before they can reach him, the airbender leaps in the air. Cut to a closer shot of the girls in the middle of the bridge as they are still creaming and reaching for the sky. They gasp for air in admiration when they see that Aang is suspended in the air by clinging to an airball. The ball, however, slowly reduces in size until it vanishes completely. Aang looks scared as he drops down into the crowd of little girl who happily catch him.",
