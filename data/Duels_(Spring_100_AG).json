Following a desperate plea from Lee's mother, Zuko agreed to rescue the boy from the Earth Kingdom men. Soon after arriving at the scene, a fight ensued, with Zuko easily overpowering and defeating almost all the soldiers only with his broadswords. After several minutes of fighting, Gow was the only man remaining. The two began a duel, with Gow initiating the conflict with strong powerful attacks. Gow attacked Zuko using his hammers to augment his earthbending while Zuko attempted to fight back without firebending. However, Gow was able to overpower Zuko and break his stance, seemingly winning the duel until Zuko unleashed his firebending prowess, easily defeating Gow in the process."

They defeated most of the Dai Li agents, while Appa returned and defeated the rest by smashing into them.

They were soon ambushed by Dai Li agents, who had orders from Long Feng to apprehend them. Team Avatar and the Dai Li battled viciously, and as the battle progressed, Long Feng realized that he is losing. He escaped, but was immediately pursued by Aang and Jet. Despite being cornered, Long Feng was able to order a hypnotized Jet into attacking Aang. Aang snapped Jet out of the trance, however, and Jet threw one of his hook swords at Long Feng. Long Feng dodged it and fatally struck Jet with a large rock. Smellerbee and Longshot stayed behind with a dying Jet, while Team Avatar left to go back to the surface to save Appa. They defeated most of the Dai Li agents, while Appa returned and defeated the rest by smashing into them. Long Feng tried to kill Appa, though unsuccessful, as Appa caught him by the leg and threw him into the lake. With all the enemy combatants defeated, the team happily reunited with their lost friend."
