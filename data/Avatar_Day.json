She announces to the village that she did indeed kill Chin the Great, or Chin the Conqueror, as she calls him. He was conquering neighboring lands and was planning on conquering Kyoshi's village, which at the time was situated on a peninsula. To protect her people, she confronted Chin's army alone, coming face to face with the surprisingly short warlord. However, instead of fighting, Kyoshi used the Avatar State to separate the entire peninsula from the mainland, pushing it into the ocean to form Kyoshi Island. In the process, Kyoshi's airbending scattered and decimated Chin's army. Chin himself was left standing on a weakening overhang at the end of the cliff. He cried out in frustration, but because he was too stubborn to walk away, he fell to his death when the ground broke off from under his feet."

The village brings out a ${link_0} for Aang to spin to determine his punishment.

Fearing for his safety, the mayor quickly changes the punishment to community service and pleads with Aang to \"do a service to the community\" by defeating the warriors, which he, Sokka, and Katara do. The trio engages the warriors in battle and is successful in driving them away. Sokka regains his boomerang during the battle exclaiming, \"Boomerang! You do always come back!\" In an act of thanks, the mayor decides that in the future, Avatar Day will honor the day Avatar Aang saved the town from the Rough Rhinos. Since Aang was not boiled in oil on that day, the celebration involves eating effigies of the Avatar made from ${link_1}.
