It was made out of white painted stone, boasting green roof tiles, and paper windows. The front door led to a wooden floor hallway, which led to a small entryway of the gym in the center, which had light green stone tiles. It seemed to have about four rooms, each with a window looking out toward the city. It also had a big flat rock that had a metal, red-winged boar. From the academy, it was possible to see the gates of Yu Dao."
