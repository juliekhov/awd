Appa becomes tired from carrying so many people, so they have to walk on foot. When they reach a cliff that descends into a misty canyon below, Toph exclaims that they have arrived at the temple, though no one else sees it. Aang realizes they have indeed arrived, as the temple is built on the underside of the cliff. Even Toph, who remained impassive at every other impressive or unusual thing the team has encountered beforehand, is amazed at the temple."

He apologizes for burning Toph, stating that fire is a dangerous and wild element and that he must control his bending so that he does not hurt others unintentionally again. Reminded of his own firebending experience that burned Katara, Aang decides to accept Zuko into the group as his teacher, but only if the others agree. Toph says playfully that she accepts Zuko so that she can get back at him for burning her feet, while Sokka accepts him only to help their plan of defeating the Fire Lord. Katara reluctantly agrees, only because it is what Aang believes is right. Zuko enthusiastically promises not to let the group down."

She warns him that while he may have the others convinced, they both know this is not the first time he has struggled to do the right thing. She makes a very clear threat: should Zuko show any act of treachery, make any mistake, or give her any reason to make her think he would hurt Aang, she will not hesitate to take his life.
