While in search for new airbenders across the Earth Kingdom, Team Avatar was notified on the Future Industries airship radio that a new airbender had been found in Zaofu. Korra later used the Metal Clan's strong radio transmitter to contact Tenzin at the Northern Air Temple, informing him of a new recruit to come his way. She also offered the frustrated master advice on how to get the recruits into shape. During the attack on the Beifong estate, Wei and Wing and Mako used portable radios to coordinate the rescue mission of Korra out of the hands of the Red Lotus."
