After Aang openly showed his disapproval on the many \"upgrades\", Teo took Aang and Katara to an unblemished part of the temple, the hallway leading up to the ${link_0}. On the way, he pointed out to the young airbender that even though the temple might be different, the creatures living there, like the ${link_1}, were likely direct descendants of the ones living there during the time of the Air Nomads. This prodded Aang to later realize that even though Teo and the other Earth Kingdom refugees were not born there, they had \"found this empty shell and made it [their] home\", drawing a comparison with the native hermit crabs.
