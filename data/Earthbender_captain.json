Iroh initially stated that everything was fine, though swiftly reconsidered and complained that his handcuffs were too loose, asking for them to be tightened. Though he was surprised by such a request, the captain ordered his corporal to do as asked. However, Iroh had tricked him, as the firebender had heated his chains and pressed the corporal's hand against them, burning him, before firebending from his feet at the rest of the troops in order to facilitate his escape. While the earthbender captain attempted to calm down two started ostrich horses by pulling tightly on their reins, he watched as Iroh rolled down a mountainside."
