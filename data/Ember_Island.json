      "text": "During Zuko's childhood, the Royal Family visited their summer home on Ember Island once every year. Several of Zuko's flashbacks revealed that the family was a lot happier during those days on the island and also showed his close relationship with Iroh and Lu Ten. Several years later, Zuko visited the beach house and recalled his memories of visiting the island in his childhood. After Azula attacked the Western Air Temple, and forced Team Avatar to abandon it, they made their way here, where they resided until the arrival of Sozin's Comet."
