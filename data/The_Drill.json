Azula spots him and, intending to intercept him, sends a powerful blue fire blast at him at close range. However, Aang speeds past it, missing the blast by a fraction of a second, and slams down on the rock. The impact causes the compromised braces of the drill to snap and the excess slurry burst out of the machine. Broken down, the drill is left jammed partially in the Outer Wall. Azula, who was tossed back by the release of air when Aang struck the rock, slides down the drill to join Ty Lee, who is sitting in the slurry, having been freed from her predicament once the influx of slurry stopped. Mai emerges from one of the hatches completely dry and casually announces to the two that they lost."
