When they arrived, they discovered Omashu had been captured by the Fire Nation and renamed New Ozai. In dismay, the team rescued Bumi, who advised Aang to search for someone who waits and listens before striking. Eventually traveling to the city of Gaoling, they met Toph Beifong, a powerful blind girl, who joined them in an effort to leave her overprotective parents and save the world. Aang began learning earthbending under Toph and continued practicing waterbending with Katara as his master. The team vacationed leisurely until they arrived at a secret library in the Si Wong Desert. There, they learned of a solar eclipse which would render all firebenders powerless. The group decided to bring this information to the Earth King, before discovering Appa had been captured. They eventually crossed the Serpent's Pass, where they reunited with Suki and arrived at their destination: the Earth Kingdom capital, Ba Sing Se."
