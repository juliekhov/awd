Eventually, the Omashu Resistance made a deal with the governor of Omashu to exchange Tom-Tom, the governor's son, for the king. Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee met Team Avatar near the base of a statue in Omashu to execute the deal. King Bumi was lowered by a crane to the ground, but was revealed as being secured in an encasement that tightly covered his entire body, save for his face. As the Fire Nation girls discussed the losses that would result from Bumi's release, the king nodded in approval. The deal was not passed, and Bumi was again lifted to the air. Bumi was intercepted by Aang, who flew up to the cage and tried to smash the metal chain to free Bumi, as he was not willing to give up. The king was surprised by the young airbender's effort. The chain broke and Bumi, still in his cage, plummeted to a delivery chute below along with Aang."
