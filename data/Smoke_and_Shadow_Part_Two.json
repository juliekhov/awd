Aang reassures him that he will get the hang of it with more practice and thanks Iroh for allowing him to host the meeting there, who is pleased to do so, finding tea and meditation to go well together. Sokka and Katara arrive, asking if he is ready go, as everything is already packed on Appa. Iroh asks where they will be going, and Sokka excitedly answers they are going to the South Pole. Aang explains that they have been meaning to do so ever since meeting Sokka and Katara's friends in the Earthen Fire Refinery. Katara looks forward to meeting Hakoda again, Aang is excited to go penguin sledding, and Sokka wishes to eat auntie Ashuna's seal jerky again. Katara is confused by Sokka, remembering that he hated Ashuna's seal jerky, but Sokka explains that \"absence makes the heart grow fonder\". Aang appreciates the good weather, believing it will let them travel fast. Suddenly, a messenger hawk arrives with a message from Zuko to Aang, regarding spirit threats in the Fire Nation. Aang asks them to join him, but Sokka points out that Spirit World affairs usually take a long time to resolve. Katara tells Aang to take Appa and meet them at the South Pole after the issue is dealt with. Aang apologizes, and Katara says it comes with dating the Avatar. Aang takes off on Appa, and Katara and Sokka bid Iroh farewell."

Aang is appalled by this and wonders where his past incarnation was at the time, though Zuko brings up the possibility of this happening before the advent of the first Avatar. After the mothers' deaths, dark spirits began to haunt Toz and his men, drifting into his encampments at night and kidnapping children as well. Toz's followers deserted the camps in fear, and his regime fell. The dark spirits were the Kemurikage, whose sadness was insatiable.

      "text": "Suki reports to Zuko that the Kyoshi Warriors have finished their rounds. Suki offers him company, which he accepts. She assures him Tom-Tom will be found, but finding him is not on Zuko's mind. He recounts a picnic he and Mai took Tom-Tom to when Michi had errands to run. At first, he was annoyed, wanting to spend time alone with Mai, but Tom-Tom began chasing a glow moth. He was so happy, and Zuko could not remember a time he himself felt\u00a0so elated. Zuko was impressed that despite what he went through in Omashu, Tom-Tom was still able to experience such happiness, and wonders if when he is found, he will still be able to feel that happy again. Zuko notices smoke coming out of Kiyi's room and rushes there. The Kemurikage have taken Kiyi but are intercepted by Zuko, Aang, Suki, and Ty Lee. Zuko and Aang firebend at them, and one of them kicks Aang in retaliation. Certain now that they are human, Aang tells Ty Lee to chi block them. Suki\u00a0grabs hold of\u00a0the one holding Kiyi, who passes the child to another Kemurikage. They begin shrouding the area in smoke, obscuring themselves, but Aang airbends the smoke away, allowing Zuko to land a hit on one of them. Zuko demands to know where his half-sister was taken; however, the Kemurikage suddenly attacks with lightning, causing Zuko to conclude that the Kemurikage is none other than\u00a0Azula."
