Aang reassures him that he will get the hang of it with more practice and thanks Iroh for allowing him to host the meeting there, who is pleased to do so, finding tea and meditation to go well together. Sokka and Katara arrive, asking if he is ready go, as everything is already packed on Appa. Iroh asks where they will be going, and Sokka excitedly answers they are going to the South Pole. Aang explains that they have been meaning to do so ever since meeting Sokka and Katara's friends in the Earthen Fire Refinery. Katara looks forward to meeting Hakoda again, Aang is excited to go penguin sledding, and Sokka wishes to eat auntie Ashuna's seal jerky again. Katara is confused by Sokka, remembering that he hated Ashuna's seal jerky, but Sokka explains that \"absence makes the heart grow fonder\". Aang appreciates the good weather, believing it will let them travel fast. Suddenly, a messenger hawk arrives with a message from Zuko to Aang, regarding spirit threats in the Fire Nation. Aang asks them to join him, but Sokka points out that Spirit World affairs usually take a long time to resolve. Katara tells Aang to take Appa and meet them at the South Pole after the issue is dealt with. Aang apologizes, and Katara says it comes with dating the Avatar. Aang takes off on Appa, and Katara and Sokka bid Iroh farewell."

Zuko himself is not sure how many there have been, as all the history books he read began with Sozin, and wonders if a certain figure he sees will have been the first Fire Lord. Kei Lo finds the Kemurikage on a mural, and Mai locates a scroll, recording the Kemurikage's origins. Mai asks Aang for lighting, but Zuko provides it instead. She begins to read the records, which date back to before the creation of the Fire Nation, when the Fire Islands were ruled by warlords. Back in that time, the warlords fought each other for territory, with the common people usually getting caught between the conflicts. The cruelest and most ruthless of them, Toz, demanded tributes from the tribes in his territory once per year. One day, one of the villages refused to give him tributes, so Toz had all the village's children kidnapped, whom were never seen again, and their mothers died of sadness. Aang is appalled by this and wonders where his past incarnation was at the time, though Zuko brings up the possibility of this happening before the advent of the first Avatar. After the mothers' deaths, dark spirits began to haunt Toz and his men, drifting into his encampments at night and kidnapping children as well. Toz's followers deserted the camps in fear, and his regime fell. The dark spirits were the Kemurikage, whose sadness was insatiable. As Mai finishes the story, a wisp of smoke comes out of the illustration of the Kemurikage on the mural. Aang feels the smoke wants him to follow it, despite Zuko's protests. Kei Lo asks if this sort of thing is a common occurrence, which Zuko confirms to be the case with the Avatar, Mai commenting Zuko has interesting friends.",

Zuko himself is not sure how many there have been, as all the history books he read began with Sozin, and wonders if a certain figure he sees will have been the first Fire Lord. Kei Lo finds the Kemurikage on a mural, and Mai locates a scroll, recording the Kemurikage's origins. Mai asks Aang for lighting, but Zuko provides it instead. She begins to read the records, which date back to before the creation of the Fire Nation, when the Fire Islands were ruled by warlords. Back in that time, the warlords fought each other for territory, with the common people usually getting caught between the conflicts. The cruelest and most ruthless of them, Toz, demanded tributes from the tribes in his territory once per year. One day, one of the villages refused to give him tributes, so Toz had all the village's children kidnapped, whom were never seen again, and their mothers died of sadness. Aang is appalled by this and wonders where his past incarnation was at the time, though Zuko brings up the possibility of this happening before the advent of the first Avatar. After the mothers' deaths, dark spirits began to haunt Toz and his men, drifting into his encampments at night and kidnapping children as well. Toz's followers deserted the camps in fear, and his regime fell. The dark spirits were the Kemurikage, whose sadness was insatiable. As Mai finishes the story, a wisp of smoke comes out of the illustration of the Kemurikage on the mural. Aang feels the smoke wants him to follow it, despite Zuko's protests. Kei Lo asks if this sort of thing is a common occurrence, which Zuko confirms to be the case with the Avatar, Mai commenting Zuko has interesting friends."
