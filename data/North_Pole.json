Although the portal remained sealed until 171 AG, strong spiritual energy in the North still prompted spirits to dance in the skies, causing the celestial phenomenon known as the northern lights. Although the spirit forest was flooded out by Tonraq's forces in 151 AG, it remains completely thawed, providing a sharp contrast to the surrounding tundras, which remain largely intolerable even to locals acclimated to polar conditions.",
