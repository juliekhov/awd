In the late 70's, Sifu Kisu began studying karate and jujitsu with his uncles upon their return from Vietnam. Kisu was later sent off to learn Shorin-ryu under Robert Yarnell in St. Louis. After this, Sifu Kisu got involved with taekwondo, specifically the ITF fighting style system, and had the great fortune to study with Master Kong Eng Moo. He later accompanied Master Kong to the Kukkiwon in Korea. Kisu continued to learn taekwondo from his master and former Korean president Park Chung-hee's bodyguards.",
