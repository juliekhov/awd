They were eventually freed by Zaheer himself, however, as he needed them to relay a message to Korra. As the brothers left the prison, the chaos brought forth by Hou-Ting's assassination became apparent; procuring themselves an airship, they saved their family from the flames that consumed the lower ring and headed toward the Misty Palm Oasis, where they reunited with Korra and Asami, relaying the message that Zaheer was threatened to kill the airbenders at the Northern Air Temple unless Korra surrendered. With no suitable radio nearby, the group returned to Zaofu to seek solid communication and warn the airbenders of the imminent threat."

Being asked by Korra how the police force was treating him, Bolin happily told her he was doing great, having made his first arrest and looking, according to Opal, more handsome in his police uniform than his Earth Empire attire. In turn, he asked how Korra and Asami's vacation had been, noting that he wanted to hear all about it. As the women turned to each other, discussing whether or not they should tell the brothers about their relationship, Bolin picked up on their hesitation and excitedly wondered if they had any good gossip for them. Before the couple could say anything, however, Bolin became startled by Jinora's spiritual projection, who had appeared to warn Team Avatar about the ongoing attack of the Triple Threat Triad on the spirit portal."
