They had planned to assassinate the governor's wife and daughter by earthbending a rock down one of the delivery slides. This attempt, however, was foiled by Aang, who used his airbending to deflect the rock. Believing them to be the assassins, Mai chased Aang and his friends. Despite the fact that they foiled their plot, Yung and the resistance members helped Team Avatar to escape by earthbending them into the sewers. Once down in the tunnels, Yung explained his frustration at merely surrendering the city without a fight. After hearing his resolve, Aang pointed out that the resistance was outnumbered and unable to win against the Fire Nation, instead suggesting to leave the city \"to fight another day\". The captain was initially against this plan, but after his subordinates declared that they were convinced by the Avatar's words, Yung hesitantly agreed."
