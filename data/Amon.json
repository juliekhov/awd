However, Noatak defended his brother by bloodbending his own father, stating that Yakone, having been stripped of his waterbending by the Avatar, was actually the weak one and that they were his children rather than his \"tools of vengeance\". He subsequently offered his brother to join him to start a new life away from Yakone, but Tarrlok declined, arguing that he was worried about their mother, thus causing Noatak to agree with their father's opinion of Tarrlok being weak.

When Tarrlok refused to bloodbend Noatak, Yakone became angry, calling him weak, and prepared to attack him as punishment. However, Noatak defended his brother by bloodbending his own father, stating that Yakone, having been stripped of his waterbending by the Avatar, was actually the weak one and that they were his children rather than his \"tools of vengeance\". He subsequently offered his brother to join him to start a new life away from Yakone, but Tarrlok declined, arguing that he was worried about their mother, thus causing Noatak to agree with their father's opinion of Tarrlok being weak. After flinging Yakone in the snow, Noatak ran off into the blizzard, prompting Yakone and Tarrlok to search for him in the following days; they eventually assumed that he had perished in the storm."

He warned his men not to underestimate her and ordered them to electrify the box, which would leave her knocked out when they opened it. However, as he was putting Tarrlok in the truck in which they had arrived, Korra stormed out of the cabin, having overpowered the other Equalists. Noticing Amon, she shot several ice spears in his direction; the Equalist leader evaded them all and briefly gave chase, but stopped when Korra made her escape by swiftly gliding down the snowy slopes of the mountain. When the Lieutenant and the other Equalists joined him in watching the Avatar leave, he scolded them for having underestimated her."
