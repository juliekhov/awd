      "text": "One of these patrol ships was hijacked on Sokka's suggestion by Team Avatar and the Southern Water Tribe warriors, who used it to escape the bay without notice by the Fire Nation when they needed to hide to give the fallen Aang time to recover. They were intercepted by another cruiser, and after a failed attempt at trickery, the second cruiser gave chase. Toph launched boulders at the enemy cruiser to disable its weapons, but the cruiser was able to damage the hijacked ship and pierce through the hull underwater with a harpoon. Katara used her waterbending to temporarily seal the hole with ice and form some fog for cover. Eventually, the giant sea serpent appeared and attacked the pursuing ship, allowing the hijacked ship to escape. When Aang tried infiltrating the Fire Nation soon after, he was forced to dive under the blockade of Fire Nation cruisers that guarded the border of the Fire Nation waters."
