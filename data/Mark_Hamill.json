Hamill had initially played a guest voice-role as corrupt businessman Ferris Boyle in the episode \"Heart of Ice\" and was delighted when offered the role of the Joker, one of his favorite characters. The most prominent feature of his portrayal that has garnered such acclaim is his dynamic use of laughter to express the Joker's mood. Hamill referred to the Joker's laugh as being like a musical instrument and would practice laughing maniacally while driving to recording sessions, commenting that no one found this behavior strange in Los Angeles. Regarding his role as Fire Lord Ozai in Avatar: The Last Airbender, Hamill has said that he thought the script was so good that the show was sure to be cancelled, as the show seemed \"a little too deep, a little too intelligent for the kind of cartoon [he] was used to\". He was glad though that it found an audience and that parents would watch it with their kids.",
